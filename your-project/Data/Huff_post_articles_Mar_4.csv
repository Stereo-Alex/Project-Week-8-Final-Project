11,['Breaking News Reporter'],"An internal watchdog found evidence that Elaine Chao committed potential ethics violations while serving as transportation secretary under President Donald Trump, but the Justice Department declined to open an investigation.

Evidence collected by the Department of Transportation’s inspector general found that Chao had used her taxpayer-funded staff and office to do various personal tasks, as well as to help promote her wealthy family’s shipping business and sales of her father’s biography, according to the IG report released on Wednesday.

“A formal investigation into potential misuses of position was warranted,” Deputy Inspector General Mitch Behm wrote in a Tuesday letter to Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

Among the 38-page report’s concerns, the IG found that a planned trip to China by Chao in 2017 was set to improperly include her family members and several personal events. Ethical questions about the trip were raised by The New York Times and others just before it was canceled by her department.

There was evidence that Chao instructed her staff to check with the Homeland Security Department on the status of a work permit application for a student who had received an award from her family’s philanthropic foundation. Her staff was also instructed to assist her father with store repairs and to mail Christmas ornaments to her family.

The IG’s office said it additionally looked into allegations that Chao improperly steered federal funds to her home state of Kentucky, which her husband, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R), represents. It did not find any supporting evidence for this, however.

The IG’s findings were referred to the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia in December 2020. Both offices declined to open criminal investigations.

Despite the documented ethics concerns, a Chao spokesperson claimed in a statement to Politico that the IG’s report “exonerates the Secretary from baseless accusations.”

DeFazio on Wednesday commended the IG’s office for conducting the review but said he was disappointed that it was not completed and released publicly while Chao was still at the Transportation Department. Chao, whose time in office was set to end with President Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, resigned on Jan. 7 in response to the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol one day earlier.

DeFazio also expressed concern that the Justice Department declined to look into the allegations.

“Public servants, especially those responsible for leading tens of thousands of other public servants, must know that they serve the public and not their family’s private commercial interests,” he said.","['department', 'secretary', 'staff', 'chao', 'igs', 'personal', 'finds', 'cabinet', 'used', 'elaine', 'office', 'transportation', 'president', 'gain', 'public', 'inspector', 'mitch', 'general']",2021-03-04 12:09:04-05:00
12,[],"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas’ power grid manager was fired Wednesday amid growing calls for his ouster following February’s deadly blackouts that left millions of people without electricity and heat for days in subfreezing temperatures.

Bill Magness, CEO of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, becomes the second senior official to depart in the wake of the one of the worst blackouts in U.S. history. The state’s top utility regulator resigned Monday.

Magness was given a two-month termination notice by ERCOT’s board in a meeting Wednesday night. The move came as the grid operator is now under investigation by the House Oversight Committee.

“During this transition period, Bill will continue to serve as President and CEO and work with state leaders and regulators on potential reforms to ERCOT,” the organization said in a statement.

Eric Gay/AP Bill Magnessm, of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, is the second senior official to depart in the wake of one of the worst blackouts in U.S. history.

Magness, who made more than $876,000 in salary and other compensation in 2019, was the target of much of the outrage over the blackouts that began Feb. 15 when a winter storm plunged temperatures into single digits across Texas, causing skyrocketing demand for electricity to heat homes. Grid operators unplugged more than 4 million customers as the system buckled, which Magness has said was necessary to avert an even more catastrophic blackout that could have lasted months.

But the power did not flip back on for days for millions of residents, and the prolonged outages quickly escalated to a crisis of tragic proportions, as people trying to keep warm died of carbon monoxide poisoning and others froze to death. The storm and resulting blackouts have been blamed for more than 40 deaths in Texas, but the full toll may not be known for months.

At the Texas Capitol last week, lawmakers investigating the outages laid into Magness for his handling of the storm.

Over hours of testimony, Magness defended actions that he said kept the grid that serves most of Texas’ 30 million residents intact.

“It worked from keeping us (from) going into a blackout that we’d still be in today, that’s why we did it,” Magness said last Thursday. “Now it didn’t work for people’s lives, but it worked to preserve the integrity of the system.”

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has accused ERCOT of misleading the state about the readiness of the grid, placing blame for the outages almost singularly on the grid operators. His outrage has not extended to the state’s Public Utility Commission, which oversees ERCOT and is led by Abbott appointees.

But the commission has also increasingly come under fire. Chairwoman DeAnn Walker resigned after struggling in two lengthy appearances before lawmakers following the blackouts, but said others should also accept responsibility for the outages.

At least six ERCOT board members have stepped down in the aftermath of the blackouts. Many of them lived out of state, a fact that only intensified anger toward ERCOT as the crisis unfolded.","['worst', 'ercot', 'state', 'magness', 'deadly', 'outages', 'work', 'grid', 'ceo', 'blackouts', 'fired', 'worked', 'texas', 'power']",2021-03-04 08:25:44-05:00
13,['Guest Writer'],"Iris Catholique has lived for 30 years in what is now the Thaidene Nëné Indigenous Protected Area. Straddling the tree line between the boreal forest and the tundra, this swath of old-growth spruce forests, waterfalls, deep freshwater lakes and ancient ice sheets is where both her sons had their first caribou harvest when they were 10 years old.

Like many others before her, Catholique, a member of the Łutsël K’é Dene First Nation in Canada’s Northwest Territories, has taught her children how to keep Indigenous traditions alive. “Our deep relationships with and intimate knowledge of the tundra, the forest, the lakes and the rivers, and all of the animals that call those different landscapes home is what has sustained us for millennia,” she said.

For generations, however, these relationships have been threatened by the increasingly severe impacts of climate change — including more frequent wildfires and melting permafrost — as well as industrial development from oil and gas exploration, logging and mining which have pushed deeper into the region, razing trees in search of profits.

Angela Gzowski for HuffPost Iris Catholique, the Thaidene Nëné manager, at Łutsël K’é.

Catholique and her community hope that the 2019 creation of Thaidene Nëné (meaning “land of the ancestors”), which spans 6.5 million acres and includes a national park and wildlife conservation areas, will help protect this part of the forest and guarantee the community’s traditions can continue.

But extractive industries and the climate crisis still threaten the rest of the boreal region and scientists fear that this critical ecosystem may be approaching a point of no return.

The Carbon The World Forgot

The boreal forest — also known as the taiga — is the world’s largest, and perhaps most overlooked, biome. It forms a sprawling, dense ring of woodlands tucked beneath the Arctic circle, occupying vast tracts of the Northern Hemisphere from North America, to Europe and Russia. Made up of spruce, fir, pine, larch, aspen and birch trees, boreal forests comprise about one-third of all forests on the planet.

It may not be as well known as the lush rainforests further south, but it has a vital role in protecting us from climate change. “People don’t appreciate the amount of carbon that’s in the boreal,” said Jeff Wells, the vice president of boreal conservation with the Audubon Society. He calls the forests “the carbon the world forgot.”

Tropical forests may sequester more carbon from the atmosphere annually, but boreal forests store roughly 30% to 40% of all land-based carbon in the world, most of it in the soil. Colder temperatures in the northern hemisphere prevent dead biomass — such as leaves and wood — from breaking down, meaning vast amounts of carbon have accumulated over thousands of years and are stored deep in the permafrost.

The boreal’s vital role in holding back spiraling climate crisis makes the threats it faces all the more concerning.

Boreal forests are warming twice as fast as other parts of the globe, causing permafost to thaw, which releases planet-heating carbon dioxide and methane. Higher temperatures also bring an increase in pests that damage and kill trees.

Angela Gzowski for HuffPost Trees covered in snow in the Thaidene Nëné Indigenous Protected Area.

Then there are the wildfires, burning vast swaths of the forest. While fires are typically a vital part of the boreal ecosystem, with some plant species even relying on the heat to disperse their seeds, researchers say recent forest fires are alarming. They are becoming more frequent and more intense and have the potential to release the “legacy carbon” deeply buried within the boreal soil, which doesn’t usually burn in fire season.

In the Siberian boreal, fires engulfed 17 million acres of forests in just two months in 2019, then about 27 million acres in the first half of 2020. In Alaska, the number of major fires — those burning through more than 1 million acres — has increased from one nearly every five years during 1950 to 1989, to one every 2.5 years between 1990 and 2018.

Habitat loss from forest fires and climate change, as well as from industrial activity, is putting the wildlife in the boreal region at risk, from caribou and wolverines in Canada to Siberian tigers in Russia.

Climate researchers fear these problems are only getting worse and could push the boreal forests to a tipping point at which they flip from being a major carbon sink to becoming a carbon emitter.

Industry Has Long Had Its Eyes On The Forests

In addition to the climate threat, industrial activity is also eating away at the forest. And this has been particularly stark in Canada.

More than 20% of North America’s boreal forest has been given over to concessions for industrial activities such as logging, fossil fuels, hydroelectric power and mineral extraction.

“The boreal has always been exploited by humans,” said Dennis Murray, professor of ecology at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario — from the fur trade in the 1600s to forestry, and now oil and gas exploration and logging.

Canada’s boreal forests have some of the highest rates of deforestation of any intact forest landscapes on the planet. Every year, the logging industry alone cuts down nearly 1 million acres to produce timber, biofuels and even toilet paper, according to a 2020 report from Nature Canada.

“The paper products that we use [in the U.S.] to wipe up a spill on the kitchen counter … might have come from the boreal forests,” said Wells.

Fossil fuel companies are here too, many for the bitumen that lies beneath the forest. In Alberta, nearly 2 million acres of the boreal forest — an area almost 10 times the size of New York City — were razed between 2001 and 2013 to access oil sands, according to data from Global Forest Watch. Alberta’s tar sands region took over habitat that would have supported up to 400,000 breeding birds, said Wells.

Angela Gzowski for HuffPost Snowmobile traffic in Łutsël K'é.

As of May 2017, there are an estimated 450,000 oil and gas wells scattered across Alberta. About 155,000 of those are no longer active but have not been restored to prevent ongoing environmental damage. Oil and gas wells, either operating or abandoned, are prone to leaking methane — a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide. The Canadian government has been underestimating annual methane emissions from abandoned oil and gas wells by as much as 150%, according to a January study from McGill University.

The resource-rich region’s coal, metals and gems attract the mining industry. About 80% of Canada’s mines are within the boreal forest, said Wells, and at least 3,000 active and abandoned mines are located within 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) of a lake, stream or river. Some of the abandoned mines have been left in hazardous conditions, causing contaminants to leak into nearby waterways even decades after they closed, according to the Washington state-based nonprofit Boreal Songbird Initiative.

In 2019, Canada launched a remediation program that will invest $2.2 billion over 15 years to clean up eight of the largest abandoned mines in the Yukon and Northwest Territories.

But with oil, gas and mining still a large part of Canada’s economy, the boreal forests continue to be in danger. Alberta, for example, plans to make up its losses from plunging oil demand during the pandemic by leasing more lands for fossil fuel exploration, including expanding coal production. A number of new industrial projects have been approved in Canada, said Murray.

“Developers are either selling [land] off to other companies or they’re waiting for the right time for the economy to be in the right place to initiate those developments,” said Murray, “it may be to a large extent that we’re not getting the full picture of what’s already slated for the boreal forests, because some of those developments are actually lying in wait.”

Protecting The Boreal Forests

Experts, like Murray, criticize the way industry has been allowed to push into the pristine wilderness of the boreal forest.

“It’s just kind of an ad hoc approach of approving things,” said Murray, adding that coordination and prioritization from the government are key when analyzing which parts of the forest to develop. “The developments seem to always take precedence over the environmental benefits, whether it’s conservation of species or of ecosystems or carbon sequestration.”

In Canada, while mining and other industries provide jobs — in some areas, the only source of employment — the push of industry into the country’s forests has often come at the expense of the more than 600 Indigenous communities living there.

Angela Gzowski for HuffPost A sign at the Łutsël K’é airport is written in Dënesųłıné and English.

It was this threat to the Łutsël K’é Dene that persuaded its members to establish Thaidene Nëné. When the idea of establishing a national park within their traditional territory was first floated back in the 1960s, they were wary, fearing they would lose their rights to hunt and fish for food on the land.

But when diamonds and metals were discovered on Łutsël K’é Dene land in the 1990s, a mining boom ensued that cleared parts of the forest, drained lakes, and disrupted wildlife habitat, especially the caribou’s migratory patterns. The community restarted discussions with the Canadian government to protect the land.

After nearly two decades of negotiations, Thaidene Nëné Indigenous Protected Area was created in August 2019 with agreements that maintain and protect Indigenous treaty rights to hunt, fish and harvest within their territory. Łutsël K’é Dene First Nation members work as “guardians” — organizing visitor programs, monitoring wildlife, assessing water quality, and working as cooks and mechanics.

“Climate solutions must reflect the values and principles of the people and the place,” said Catholique. “The land is an integral part of the Indigenous people here, as well as other communities within the North that come and use our territory.” Wells describes it as an example of marrying Indigenous knowledge and Western science.

Threats do remain. Though establishing Thaidene Nëné prevented the development of new mines within its boundaries, there are four diamond mines — three currently active — just north of the boundaries of the protected area, where the boreal forest transitions to the melting tundra. According to Catholique, the mines are right at the heart of the calving grounds of the caribou, animals extremely important to her community. Industrial disturbances, such as roads and construction, can disrupt the caribou’s migratory patterns. Over the last two decades, caribou numbers have dwindled by more than 30%.

Angela Gzowski for HuffPost Iris’s son Tanner cuts up caribou meat at his grandmother’s home.

“I feel like our work is not done, and that we still need to expand our borders and protect other areas from industrial impact,” Catholique said.

To better protect the boreal, Indigenous-led conservation programs across the country need more funding and support from the government, said Wells. He supports Indigenous land guardian programs, similar to that in Thaidene Nëné.

More than 60 other Indigenous First Nations have launched these programs across Canada to monitor the environment and protect biodiversity in the boreal forests. In the eastern Manitoba, for instance, guardians have tested water quality around hydro dams to monitor pollution or any toxic contaminants leaking into waterways. In Labrador, they have implemented a plan to restore caribou herds and monitor some of Canada’s largest mines.

Wells praises these initiatives as a boon “both for conservation and the environment, but also for the Indigenous people in these communities to provide sources of funding, so they have jobs and opportunities to connect with their own culture and with their own lands, and not forced to deal with taking a job at a mining company.”

But guardians alone can’t save the forests, he said. There still needs to be larger-scale policy, including sweeping conservation and environmental policies and international commitments.

“It’s great that First Nations people are now given more of a voice,” Murray said, but to save the boreal forests requires managing them not as disparate fragments, but as one large biome.

In January of this year, Canada was one of more than 50 countries that announced a commitment to protect at least 30% of the planet’s land and ocean by 2030. The countries maintain a quarter of the world’s land-based carbon stores, including the boreal forests. Some conservationists say that for Canada to reach its target, it will have to look to the boreal region, designating certain areas as off-limits to industrial or extractive development and putting local stakeholders, like First Nations, in charge of managing the lands, said Wells.

The world also needs to urgently tackle the climate crisis. Even if all development projects were halted tomorrow or heavily regulated and controlled, climate-related changes are still going to happen, said Murray. “The boreal today may look, even if it’s protected, different in 100 years, just by virtue of the fact that the climate is changing so drastically — and that’s really not to be ignored.”

Angela Gzowski for HuffPost Going down a large hill on the back of a snowmobile in the Thaidene Nëné Indigenous Protected Area.

For Catholique, saving the boreal forest demands that governments, environmentalists, Indigenous communities, and even industries understand the risks and work together to avoid a worst-case scenario.

“We’re still not done with our work,” Catholique said. “Our elders wanted to make sure that the beautiful land that we live on and live from is going to be protected from future development.” She is determined to make that happen.

15,['Entertainment Editor'],"Elizabeth Olsen is here to dish.

On Wednesday, the Marvel actor joined Jimmy Fallon for a “WandaVision” parody, traveling through decades of “The Tonight Show” instead of sitcoms. And, much like her Disney+ show, the parody (which you can see above) had some twists.

In an interview after the sketch, Olsen talked about how the people who do her hair and makeup on “WandaVision” also helped get her ready for “FallonVision” ― and how one particular vintage outfit was hard to find in a pandemic.

“I had a bad idea for the ’70s, and they thought I looked not good enough. But they looked at my dish towel in my kitchen, and they were like, ‘That’s your tube top. You got to wear that for the ’70s,’” Olsen said. “I’m wearing a dishrag.”

Fallon had no idea. The show tried to send Olsen a wardrobe, but she’s in London and things didn’t get to her in time. Still, he had no idea she wasn’t wearing a regular outfit.

“Yeah, it’s a dishrag, and it just got underneath my armpits,” Olsen said as she and Fallon both started laughing.

The dishrag “doesn’t even remotely come together in the back,” Olsen revealed. If you watch the sketch again, you can see Olsen with her arms at her sides, holding it in place.

“Oh, my gosh. You got me. See, that’s what you have to do in these times. You got to be nimble. You got to be quick,” Fallon said.

16,['Senior Culture Reporter'],"Alec Baldwin has deactivated his Twitter account once again amid a tempestuous week on social media.

The “30 Rock” actor announced his decision to quit the platform in a nearly 10-minute video posted to Instagram late Wednesday. The move, he explained, was in response to backlash he received for commenting on Gillian Anderson’s use of an American accent during her Golden Globes acceptance speech last weekend.

Baldwin stopped short of mentioning Anderson by name in his video, but said he was a “huge fan” of the actor whose work he had referenced on Twitter. His comment, he added, had been intended to “illustrate the point that I find, as I said, that the multicultural expressions of anyone ― whatever country, language, music, food, clothing, art, any of it, whatever of those expressions are important to you ― that’s your business.”

“Of course you can’t do any irony on Twitter,” he said elsewhere in the clip, later blasting the platform as a place “where all the assholes in the United States and beyond go to get their advanced degrees in asshole-iness.”

Earlier Wednesday, Baldwin had tweeted a CNN report about Anderson’s performance as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Netflix’s “The Crown,” for which she nabbed a Golden Globe. The article noted that Anderson, who was born in Chicago but spent much of her childhood in London, had “accepted the award using her American accent.”

“Switching accents? That sounds...fascinating,” he wrote in the tweet.

The remark was a less-than-subtle reference to recent controversy surrounding Baldwin’s wife, Hilaria Baldwin. Since December, the yoga and health entrepreneur has been dogged by criticism after presenting herself as Spanish ― a claim that had been publicly corroborated by her husband ― even though she was born and raised in Boston by American parents.

The Anderson remark was the second time this week that Baldwin, who briefly quit Twitter in January following his wife’s heritage debacle, had made headlines with his mercurial online presence.

On Monday, he and Hilaria announced the arrival of their sixth child, Lucia. When someone questioned how the couple could have conceived a daughter so soon after they welcomed a son, Eduardo, in September 2020, Baldwin reportedly fired back, “You should shut the fuck up and mind your own business.”

It was later confirmed that the Baldwins had used a surrogate.","['quits', 'gillian', 'remark', 'fallout', 'american', 'week', 'quit', 'platform', 'amid', 'later', 'baldwin', 'anderson', 'alec', 'twitter', 'dig', 'video']",2021-03-04 11:39:11-05:00

18,['General Assignment Reporter'],"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s removal of a mask mandate and other COVID-19 safety guidelines triggered a sharpshooting rebuke from “ The Late Show ” on Wednesday. (Watch the video below.)

In a spoof using footage of a standoff from the 1966 spaghetti Western “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,” Clint Eastwood’s gunslinger character wears a mask and tries to convince Eli Wallach to do the same. Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef agree the governor is an idiot before Eastwood proposes an end to the standoff:","['western', 'late', 'standoff', 'watch', 'wallach', 'van', 'video', 'repeal', 'eastwood', 'law', 'wears', 'using', 'clint', 'texas', 'mask', 'shoots']",2021-03-04 08:41:28-05:00
19,['On Assignment For Huffpost'],"By now, you’ve probably seen at least one TikTok cooking trend, either on the app itself or through societal osmosis. Whether it’s cocoa bombs melting into milky oblivion or, perhaps most notoriously, feta melding with tomatoes before being tossed with pasta, there’s a chance at least one of these trends has entranced you. But what do chefs think?

Maria Covarrubias, founder of Cien Chiles and culinary specialist for Chosen Foods, loves these trends taking place on TikTok. People might not be cooking the most delicious food, but they are cooking.

“These trends have helped people that maybe didn’t have the courage to go into the kitchen to try simple recipes that are more approachable,” Covarrubias told HuffPost. And at a time when we’re all running a little low on energy, these hacks make life easier.

From egg-cracking to cocoa bombs, here is what chefs really think about the cooking trends taking over our small screens and kitchens.

“Apparently if you drop an egg into a pan, it cracks perfectly,” a deep voice says at the beginning of a TikTok video while a person drops an egg into a pan. Most of the time when someone does the egg-cracking challenge, it does crack perfectly, allowing the person to easily pluck the shell’s halves out of the pan.

But is it that much easier than cracking an egg … not in the pan?

“People always think they should crack an egg on a bowl, but really it’s best to crack an egg on a flat surface and get that shell loosened up so you can split the egg,” Zach Spott, chef of Denver’s Green Seed Market, told HuffPost.

Spott isn’t sure whether there’s actually an advantage to cracking the egg in a pan instead.

“Typically you’d want your pan to be somewhat hot, just to create some sort of barrier between the pan and the egg with some fat. But then you’re picking the shell out of the pan. I’m not sure I understand the idea of doing that versus just cracking it on the flat surface,” Spott said.

Try it if you want to, but keep in mind that whether it works or not is highly dependent on the egg itself.

“You can get a dozen eggs and get a shell that’s really hard, give it a tap, and it breaks perfectly. Then you can get an egg that feels almost like tissue paper, give it a crack, and it crumbles and spiderwebs,” Melissa Gaman, a recipe developer based in New York, told HuffPost.

Cocoa bombs made waves especially around the holiday season. In these videos, people pour hot milk over chocolate spheres and watch in awe as the chocolate melts away, revealing an interior filled with marshmallows and cocoa mix. There are even cute varieties like white chocolate unicorns.

They’re exciting at a time when everything is boring — and they’re aesthetically pleasing, which is the big draw, Atlanta-based pastry chef Claudia Martinez said. But they aren’t necessarily more timesaving than a packet of Swiss Miss, and they’re only as good as the chocolate used to make them.

If you’re tempted to make your own cocoa bomb creation (hey, it’s still chilly in many parts of the country), Martinez advises choosing quality chocolate and melting it properly. Instead of melting your chocolate in the microwave, put a heatproof bowl over a pot of water, “then get a thermometer to temper the chocolate, so that when [you] make the little shells, they stay together and they have that snap when you pour the milk,” Martinez said.

Our brains are mushy from living through a pandemic and a grueling winter. It’s no surprise, then, that baked feta pasta has captured the attention of home cooks. It’s easy, it’s comforting and it’s probably the trend that evokes the strongest feelings ― critical or otherwise.

Gaman understands how most food trends come to be, but she was baffled by the baked feta pasta trend.

“Feta, I think, is a little bit of a divisive cheese because it can be really intense or it can be really flavorless and kind of waxy and tacky. So it’s surprising that so many people were gravitating to it,” Gaman said.

Feta, she pointed out, comes in myriad variations that range from salty and creamy to tangy and dry. It’s not a one-size-fits all cheese the way that the videos tend to imply. Gaman said she likes the ingredients of this dish individually, but that she doesn’t think combining them all together in such high quantities is the best way to showcase them.

“I would probably focus on making a delicious roasted cherry tomato sauce and then use the feta as that accent to kind of get stirred in at the end, because then you’re bringing out the best qualities of the feta,” she said.

Another option is to omit the pasta. Craig Richards, chef-owner of Lyla Lila in Atlanta, thinks the sauce could make a great dip.

“I thought this would be really good on bruschetta or grilled bread rather than with pasta, because the bread would be a better carrier for that type of thing,” Richards said. He would add garlic, chile flakes and basil, and he wouldn’t skimp on the olive oil because feta is dry. If you still want to use pasta, he suggests rigatoni to hold on to those bits of cheese.

TikTok Tortilla Wrap Hack

The tortilla wrap trend, started by TikTok user @ellcarter1, involves cutting a slit down the center of a tortilla to one edge and creating four quadrants. Place different fillings — such as proteins, aioli, guacamole, cheese, beans or anything else you desire — in each quadrant, fold it up, warm it in a pan or in the toaster oven and enjoy.

Some people rebuff the trend in favor of a traditional quesadilla, but Covarrubias loves the wrap.

“I feel it’s less bulky than a burrito and it’s the same ingredients, so I really enjoyed doing that one,” she said. “I even did a sweet one with Nutella, and one with peanut butter and jelly, and just fresh strawberry.”","['pan', 'really', 'trend', 'egg', 'chefs', 'feta', 'rate', 'food', 'think', 'chocolate', 'pasta', 'trends', 'cocoa', 'tiktok', 'bombs']",2021-03-04 10:45:13+00:00
20,"[""Women'S Reporter""]","House lawmakers just passed a bipartisan bill that would make it illegal for federal law enforcement officers to engage in sexual acts with people in their custody regardless of alleged consent ― a disturbing practice that is allowed by law due to loopholes in protections for detained people.

The Closing the Law Enforcement Consent Loophole Act, created by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), would make it a criminal offense for officers such as those in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to engage in any sexual activity with anyone in their custody or while exercising their authority as an officer.

The bill is included in the larger George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which passed 220-212 in the Democratic-controlled House on Wednesday night.

“There is no consent when one person is exercising the power of law enforcement and the other is handcuffed or in custody. My bill would close a dangerous legal loophole that has allowed law enforcement officers to claim consent as a defense against accusations of sexual assault,” Speier said in a Thursday morning statement.

Speier introduced the consent loophole act after an 18-year-old woman accused two New York detectives of raping her in 2017 while she was in custody. Although the Prison Rape Elimination Act protects inmates from sexual abuse by prison staff, the law does not protect detainees who have not been convicted of a crime. Through that loophole, New York state law allowed the officers to claim the sex was consensual despite the fact that the 18-year-old woman was handcuffed in the back of their unmarked police car. The two detectives were later sentenced to five years of probation with no jail time.

Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images Representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat from California, questions witnesses during a House Intelligence Committee impeachment inquiry hearing on Capitol Hill November 21, 2019, in Washington, D.C.

The legislation also incentivizes states to have similar laws for local and state police in order to be eligible for Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) funding. Additionally, the bill requires states to annually submit information on the number of sexual misconduct complaints against individual federal officers, and those reports will be sent to Congress for review.

On the state level, it’s still legal in 34 states for police to engage in sexual activity with someone in custody. Police officers who are accused of rape or sexual assault often claim consent as a defense but, in reality, the power imbalance is so large that there really can’t be any true consent.

“While it’s illegal in Ohio, federal law enforcement officers, as well as police officers in the majority of states, can claim a sexual encounter with someone in their custody was consensual,” co-sponsor Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio) said in a Thursday statement. “As there is an inherent imbalance of power and authority between an officer and detainee, there is no situation in which consent could be distinguished from coercion.”

The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act also bans police from using chokeholds and no-knock warrants, requires data collection on police incidents and ends qualified immunity, which is a legal rule often used to shield police from accountability.

Speier initially introduced the Closing the Law Enforcement Consent Loophole Act in 2018 and the bill passed the House in 2019, but failed to get through the Republican-controlled Senate. Lawmakers are more hopeful the bill will be successful now with a Democratic majority in the Senate.","['custody', 'detainees', 'consent', 'act', 'loophole', 'house', 'states', 'sexual', 'illegal', 'federal', 'officers', 'passes', 'making', 'law', 'bill', 'enforcement', 'sex', 'engage']",2021-03-04 12:08:23-05:00
21,"['Sarah Turnnidge', 'Huffpost Uk']","Prince Philip has undergone a successful procedure for a pre-existing heart condition, Buckingham Palace has said.

The Duke of Edinburgh, 99, has been in the hospital for more than two weeks, and underwent surgery on Wednesday.

The palace said in a statement: “The Duke of Edinburgh yesterday underwent a successful procedure for a pre-existing heart condition at St Bartholomew’s Hospital.

“His Royal Highness will remain in hospital for treatment, rest and recuperation for a number of days.”

The duke was transferred by ambulance to St Bartholomew’s Hospital in central London on Monday, after spending more than a week a King Edward VII’s hospital, where he was visited by his son Prince Charles.

The 99-year-old was seen walking into the hospital unaided on Feb. 17, with the palace describing his stay as a “precautionary measure.”

Philip, who received a COVID-19 shot in January, has suffered a number of ailments over the years, including being treated for a blocked coronary artery at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire in December 2011.

He also suffered a bladder infection in June 2012, forcing him to miss the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, and had exploratory surgery on his abdomen in June 2013.

He later pulled out of a Battle of Jutland anniversary event in June 2016, citing a minor ailment which was followed soon after by his retirement from public duty in 2017.

He spent four nights at King Edward Hospital in December 2019, where he was treated for a “pre-existing condition” and was later discharged on Christmas Eve.","['underwent', 'prince', 'condition', 'hospital', 'palace', 'recovering', 'treated', 'suffered', 'preexisting', 'surgery', 'philip', 'heart', 'successful', 'duke']",2021-03-04 05:23:08-05:00
22,"['Sarah Turnnidge', 'Huffpost Uk']","Coronavirus vaccines tweaked to deal with variants will be fast-tracked without compromising on safety or effectiveness, the UK’s regulator has said.

The approach will be similar to the regulatory process for the modified flu vaccine, to deal with new strains each year, with a brand new approval not required.

Scientists have previously said a COVID-19 variant resistant to the current crop of vaccines is likely to emerge at some point, but vaccines can also be adapted quickly.

The guidance states coronavirus vaccine manufacturers will need to provide robust evidence that the modified shot produces an immune response. However, lengthy clinical studies deemed not to add to the regulatory understanding of their safety, quality or effectiveness will not be needed.

The U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said researchers are in a better position to measure protection by looking at antibodies in the blood after vaccination, reducing the need to wait and see whether people in a trial become infected with the virus.

It said this will “significantly reduce” the length of time it takes for the modified vaccine to be ready.

The guidance from the Access Consortium – a group made up of regulatory authorities from the U.K., Australia, Canada, Singapore and Switzerland – requires that, as well as evidence on immune response, the modified vaccines must be shown to be safe and of the expected quality.

It says data from the original clinical trials and ongoing studies on real-world use in millions of people could be used to support any decision by the regulators.

Dr. Christian Schneider, chief scientific officer at the MHRA, said: “Our priority is to get effective vaccines to the public in as short a time as possible, without compromising on safety.

“Should any modifications to authorized COVID-19 vaccines be necessary, this regulatory approach should help to do just that.

“The announcement today also demonstrates the strength of our international partnerships with other regulators and how our global work can help ensure faster access to life-saving vaccines in the U.K. and around the world.

“The public should be confident that no vaccine would be approved unless the expected high standards of safety, quality and effectiveness are met.”

The news comes days after it was announced that a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could significantly reduce the risk of transmission of the virus.

A study carried out by Cambridge University found a four-fold decrease in the risk of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers who had been vaccinated for more than 12 days.

In further good news for the vaccination effort, a study published Tuesday found that both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are highly effective in reducing COVID-19 infections among older people aged 70 years and over.

Some European countries such as France had previously approved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for under-65s only, citing a lack of evidence for older people, but the French health minister announced on Wednesday that older residents could have the jab.","['older', 'uk', 'regulators', 'evidence', 'covid19', 'effectiveness', 'vaccination', 'regulatory', 'vaccines', 'vaccine', 'mutations', 'modified', 'fasttrack', 'safety']",2021-03-04 07:02:19-05:00
23,['Reporter'],"The House of Representatives passed a landmark bill on voting rights, elections, campaign finance and ethics reform by a vote of 220-210 on Wednesday.

The For the People Act, congressional Democrats’ top legislative priority, passed with 220 Democrats in support and one Democrat (Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi) and 209 Republicans in opposition. (Two Republicans did not vote.) This encapsulates a major contrast between the nation’s two major political parties: One is pushing to expand access to the ballot, the other is trying to restrict it.

The Republican Party is still led by former President Donald Trump, who just two months ago sought to overturn a free and fair election by invalidating votes in majority-Black cities. More than half of the House Republican caucus backed him. This led directly to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. And now Republicans at the state level are pushing a new wave of voting rights restrictions based on Trump’s election fraud lies, including in Georgia, where Republicans just lost the presidential race and two Senate seats.

Democrats see the march of these voter restrictions as both a direct attack on the principle of voting rights and the prospect of a pluralistic multiracial democracy and a direct threat to their own party’s ability to win majorities. They’re backing the most expansive voting rights legislation in generations in order to stop that attack.

“This is existential,” said Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), the freshman representative to House Democratic Party leadership. “Our democracy is under assault. And if we don’t pass this legislation now, my prediction is we will not have a democracy over the next decade.”

If enacted into law, the For The People Act would nullify this latest GOP wave of voter restrictions at the state level. To do so, the bill mandates that states provide no-excuse absentee voting, at least 15 days of early voting and provisional ballots; requires states to automatically register voters when they interact with a state or local government agency (unless they choose to opt out), while also providing the option of online and same-day registration; limits states from implementing mass voter roll purges and voter identification laws; and restores voting rights to people convicted of felonies upon release from prison in states that ban them from voting. These are just a few of the major provisions in the bill.

“At a time when Americans from across the political spectrum are demanding real change and accountability from their elected officials, it’s more important than ever before to deliver on the promise of H.R. 1 and restore faith in our democracy,” Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), the lead sponsor of the House bill, said in a statement. “We have no time to waste.”

ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) speaks in support of the For The People Act at an event on the U.S. Capitol steps on March 3, 2021.

Before the vote, Republicans echoed Trump’s election fraud lies, claiming that the For The People Act would enact certain measures used by states in the 2020 election that Trump falsely asserted led to “fraud that has never been seen like this before.” They claimed that expanding absentee voting and limiting voter restrictions would further weaken trust in elections, even after the majority of them had backed Trump’s lies that weakened public trust to further Trump’s personal interests.

Some Republicans lied about the contents of the bill, claiming it would let 16-year-olds and undocumented immigrants register to vote. Others ― like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who had effectively voted to overturn the 2020 election on Jan. 6 ― linked the bill to the Republican Party’s newfound organizing principle in opposition to so-called “cancel culture.”

“First, they outlaw Dr. Seuss and now they want to tell us what to say,” McCarthy said in opposition to the bill’s reorganization of the Federal Election Commission to give it a majority of commissioners from one party.

The bill will now head to the Senate, where it is likely to be filibustered by Republicans opposed to its voting rights, campaign finance and ethics reforms.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has called the bill a “power grab” and “socialism.” When it first passed the House in 2019, McConnell blocked any consideration in the then-Republican-controlled Senate. But with the Senate now under Democratic control, the push for the bill will set up the first of many tests for Senate Democrats as they debate whether to change the chamber’s filibuster rules or watch the GOP stall President Joe Biden’s agenda.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), one of the two lead Senate sponsors of the bill, told HuffPost that she plans to “make this our number one priority for legislation.” She plans to hold the first hearing on the bill in the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, which she chairs, on March 24 after the Senate finishes work on the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package.

Both Klobuchar and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the bill’s other lead sponsor, back any range of changes to Senate rules to get this bill to Biden’s desk ― up to and including eliminating the filibuster.

“Let’s see how many things they keep blocking,” Klobuchar said about the fate of the filibuster. “You can only use reconciliation so far.”

Our democracy is under assault. And if we don’t pass this legislation now, my prediction is we will not have a democracy over the next decade. Rep. Mondaire Jones

Beyond its voting rights section, the For The People Act contains sweeping changes to the nation’s campaign finance laws, bans on partisan gerrymandering, and new ethics requirements for the executive branch and federal judiciary.

The campaign finance provisions include a ban on undisclosed “dark money,” further restrictions on super PAC coordination, the restructuring of the FEC, mandated disclosure of online advertising, and creation of an optional public financing system for congressional campaigns.

The proposed public financing system stems from a bill introduced in prior Congresses by Sarbanes. It would provide $6 in public funds for every $1 raised in small contributions (those up to $200) for participating candidates. The public funds would come from a new small fee added to some fines and settlement payments levied on corporations by the Treasury Department.

Even though the public funding would come from fees on fines, Republicans last year targeted attack ads at some swing-state House Democrats who’d voted for the bill in 2019, accusing them of voting to use taxpayer money to fund political campaigns. The discomfort of those 2020 attack ads led a group of moderate Democrats to add an amendment to the bill on Tuesday restating that no taxpayer funds would be used to pay for the public financing system. This amendment did no more than restate the bill’s existing provisions.

A more significant change came after members of the Congressional Black Caucus objected to the bill’s anti-gerrymandering provisions. The bill initially mandated that states draw their House district boundaries through independent, nonpartisan redistricting panels in this year’s redistricting process. The CBC amendment pushes the mandated use of such independent panels to the 2030-31 redistricting cycle while still imposing new rules that would severely restrict partisan gerrymandering during the current process.

The fate of the bill now lies with the Senate. Despite an increasing push to eliminate or change the filibuster rules, centrist Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have stated, in no uncertain terms, their opposition to doing so.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) intends to put the bill on the floor and force Republicans to filibuster it. Last year, at the funeral of civil rights hero and Georgia congressman John Lewis, former President Barack Obama called for Democrats to end the filibuster in order to pass a reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. Lewis just so happens to have been the author of the major voting rights section in the For The People Act.

The success of the Democratic Party’s agenda now hinges on whether they let their efforts be hamstrung by the filibuster rules or find a way to enact laws again. The For The People Act will be just the first such test.","['setting', 'act', 'voting', 'senate', 'house', 'fight', 'states', 'republicans', 'rules', 'public', 'rights', 'passes', 'bill', 'major', 'filibuster', 'landmark']",2021-03-03 23:13:16-05:00
24,['Reporter'],"But on Wednesday, Kemp swore allegiance to the defeated former president, should Trump make good on his threat to run for the White House again in 2024.

“Real quickly, Donald Trump as the ’24 nominee for Republicans, would you support him?” Kemp was asked by Fox News’ Neil Cavuto.

“Absolutely,” Kemp responded. “I’m going to support the nominee. As I said again, I worked very hard for the president.” Trump’s ideas would be “part of our party for a long time in the future,” Kemp predicted.

“Republicans, we need to have a big tent,” he added. “There’s a lot of great ideas out there, we’re not always going to get along. But I think the president deserves a lot of credit and he’s not going away.”

Watch the video here:

Trump repeatedly attacked Brian Kemp for not working to overturn the election results for him, called for his resignation and even gave a speech in Georgia saying he'd campaign against him, but here's Kemp just now on Fox News saying he'd support Trump in 2024 anyway pic.twitter.com/NN5z9aYalr — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 3, 2021

Only on Saturday, Trump described Kemp’s performance as “sad.” That followed months of trash-talking the governor for failing to aid Trump’s efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s narrow win in Georgia. At one point, Trump said he was “ashamed” to have endorsed Kemp’s election.

Kemp’s turnaround follows that of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who last week also said he’d “absolutely” back Trump if he became the 2024 GOP nominee.

Less than two weeks earlier, McConnell had declared Trump as “practically and morally responsible” for inciting the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, even though he voted for acquittal in Trump’s Senate impeachment trial.

Colbert addressed a wave of voter suppression measures backed by GOP lawmakers. Among the hundreds of bills to restrict voting access in 43 states, the Georgia House of Representatives passed a bill Monday that would limit absentee and early voting, which tend to be favored by Democrats.

Supporters of the bill said it would restore confidence in the election system, but Colbert pointed out that the state’s Republican governor, the secretary of state, and the voting systems manager all confirmed that last November’s election was fair.

“So there’s plenty of confidence in the election,” Colbert said. “You’re just confident you’re gonna lose it, so you’re tilting the playing field. That’s like the NFL restricting Tom Brady to restore confidence in the Kansas City Chiefs.”

30,['Reporter'],"The House passed a bill on Wednesday aimed at helping prevent police misconduct, naming the legislation after a Black man who was killed by Minneapolis police last May in a violent arrest that triggered nationwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality.

The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed 220-212 in the Democratic-controlled House. The legislation bans police from using chokeholds and no-knock warrants, requires data collection on police encounters and ends qualified immunity ― a legal doctrine often used to shield police from accountability.

The House just passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.

The bill also authorizes new grant funding for community-based organizations to implement evidence-based initiatives like violence interruption and hospital-based violence intervention ― strategies to keep neighborhoods safe that mostly don’t involve police.

Ten months ago, then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, killed Floyd after kneeling on his neck for several minutes while he was handcuffed and face down on the street. Footage of the incident that went viral on social media showed Floyd begging officers for air, saying he couldn’t breathe. After pressure had already built up from repeated deaths of Black people at the hands of police, Floyd’s death broke the dam and resulted in protests across the country ― with some people calling for police reform, some demanding police funds go to social services and others calling for police abolition.

“My city is not an outlier but rather an example of the inequalities our country has struggled with for centuries,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), whose district includes Minneapolis, said inside as she presided over House debate and called the vote ahead of the bill’s passage.

“Today we find ourselves at a crossroads,” she added. “Will we have the moral courage to pursue justice and secure meaningful change, or will we succumb to this moment?”

House Democrats first introduced and passed the bill, mostly along party lines, last year in the wake of Floyd’s death, but the legislation failed in the Republican-controlled Senate. Democrats hope the bill will pass both chambers this time, now that the Senate has a 50-50 partisan split, with Vice President Kamala Harris able to serve as a tie-breaker for the Democrats.

“We will begin those discussions with the Senate immediately after the bill is passed,” Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who is helping lead police reform efforts in the House, told reporters ahead of the Wednesday vote. “Over the last several weeks, discussions, especially with Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), have been underway.”

But despite the bill’s passage in the House, not all advocacy groups are on board with what they see as the legislation’s limited scope.

“While we understand the urgency to pass police reform at the federal level, we can’t do it in a way that merely provides a veneer of justice while sacrificing real systemic change at the most opportune moment to achieve it,” Maritza Perez, spokesperson for the Drug Policy Alliance, said in a statement.

Perez noted that the bill does not fully address issues such as police militarization, quick-knock raids and police practices disproportionately used against people of color in drug investigations

“Unfortunately, because House leadership chose to fast-track last year’s bill, rather than addressing advocates’ and community members’ concerns, that’s exactly the compromise they have made, and today’s vote solidified those failings,” she added. “The House-passed bill fails to provide for real reform and accountability and we oppose this bill in its current form.”","['misconduct', 'reform', 'vote', 'justice', 'george', 'floyd', 'country', 'senate', 'designed', 'house', 'legislation', 'passes', 'prevent', 'bill', 'help', 'passed']",2021-03-03 23:36:55-05:00
31,['Senior Culture Reporter'],"Alec Baldwin alluded to wife Hilaria Baldwin’s recent heritage controversy this week while taking a dig at Gillian Anderson’s ability to switch between accents.

The “30 Rock” actor on Wednesday tweeted a CNN report about Anderson’s Golden Globe win for Netflix’s “The Crown,” in which she played former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Anderson, who was born in Chicago but spent much of her childhood in London, was noted as having “accepted the award using her American accent.”

The “X-Files” and “Sex Education” star is quoted in the article as saying she “tried hard to cling on to my British accent” when her family relocated from England to Grand Rapids, Michigan, when she was 11. And though she’s once again based in London, she added, “I just slip into one or the other.”

Apparently, that didn’t sit well with Baldwin, who tweeted, “Switching accents? That sounds...fascinating.”

Baldwin’s tweet was a less-than-subtle reference to his wife, who last year was accused of having appropriated elements of Spanish heritage.

Days before Christmas, Hilaria Baldwin’s background was the subject of a viral Twitter thread that accused her of a “decade long grift.” The accusation referred to the yoga and health entrepreneur presenting herself as Spanish ― a claim that had been publicly corroborated by her husband ― even though she was born and raised in Boston by American parents.

After it was revealed that her given name at birth was not Hilaria, but Hillary Hayward-Thomas, many questioned the legitimacy of her sometimes Spanish accent. That ensuing backlash prompted Alec Baldwin to briefly quit Twitter in January after he likened the social media platform to “a party where everyone is screaming.”

Last month, Hilaria Baldwin issued a lengthy apology on Instagram in which she said she’d been “listening, reflecting, and asking myself how I can learn and grow” in the weeks since the controversy broke.

“My parents raised my brother and me with two cultures, American and Spanish, and I feel a true sense of belonging to both,” the mother of six wrote. “The way I’ve spoken about myself and my deep connection to two cultures could have been better explained ― I should have been more clear and I’m sorry.”","['tweeted', 'gillian', 'american', 'subtweets', 'wife', 'hilaria', 'crown', 'raised', 'switch', 'baldwin', 'anderson', 'alec', 'london', 'having', 'accent', 'spanish', 'twitter', 'star']",2021-03-03 17:28:22-05:00

33,['On Assignment For Huffpost'],"The sweeping grasslands, dry forests, scrub and rugged mountains of Brazil’s Cerrado encompass some of the country’s most beautiful national parks. The region’s rich habitat features 11,000 species of plants and more than 200 varieties of mammals, including jaguars, anteaters, armadillos and tapirs.

“It is the most diverse savanna in the world,” said Mercedes Bustamante, an ecology professor at the University of Brasília and a Cerrado specialist.

The Cerrado, which covers more than 20% of the country, is also an important motor in Brazil’s economy, producing over half of Brazil’s beef, 49% of its soybeans, 47% of its sugar cane and almost all its cotton, according to the government agricultural research institute Embrapa.

To raise those crops, the region’s native forests and vegetation are being systematically replaced by farms and ranches. Under Brazilian law, the Cerrado enjoys much less protection than the iconic Amazon rainforest to its north. Half of its land has already been cleared, including some 2,800 square miles last year alone. (That compares to about 20% of the Brazilian Amazon gone.)

Under pressure from the ceaseless agricultural demand and the ravages of climate change, the vital biome is being destroyed at a frightening rate ― and even as its agriculture helps drive the economy, that’s bad news for Brazil.

The Cerrado plays a vital role in Brazil’s water supply, feeding eight of the country’s 12 hydrographic regions and with that much of the country’s electricity supply, around two-thirds of which comes from hydroelectric dams — which makes the signs of climate change that some parts of the Cerrado are experiencing all the more concerning.

While there are no major definitive studies into the Cerrado-wide impacts of land clearing for agriculture, there is plenty of region-specific research that points to trouble. In one so-called transition area, in Mato Grosso state — where the southern Amazon meets the western Cerrado — a study by Costa and others found that deforestation is delaying the onset of the rainy season. Fewer trees and less native vegetation reduces evapotranspiration, the process by which water transfers from plants and soil to the atmosphere, which is a vital part of the water cycle.

Dado Galdieri for HuffPost A typical swampy area in the Cerrado, fed by rainwater and the Urucuia aquifer in Bahia state.

Researchers including Costa have also studied the longer dry season in western Bahia state, finding that rainfall has decreased 12% since the 1980s and river discharges have also declined. Land clearing has degraded weather in the northeast Cerrado region where it meets the Amazon, according to another study by researchers from Dartmouth College ― whose modeling found more warm nights, more hot days and less evapotranspiration.

The Cerrado is sometimes called an “upside-down” forest because of the deep, extensive roots its native plants use to dig down for nutrients and moisture. The roots and soil store high levels of carbon, making the region an important carbon sink. But as industrial agriculture continues to swallow up huge tracts of the Cerrado, it could become “a source of carbon,” said Bustamante, meaning it would emit more of the climate-warming gas than it stores.

Yet despite the grave risks, the region remains hugely underprotected. While nearly half of the Amazon rainforest is legally shielded against deforestation, just 7.7% of the Cerrado is. Amazon farmers are allowed to clear 20% of their land; Cerrado farmers can clear trees and native vegetation on up to 80% of their land.

Even with these lax restrictions on land clearing, there is still plenty of illegal deforestation in the Cerrado. A 2020 report published by the monitoring network Trase, along with Brazilian nonprofits Imaflora and ICV, found that 95% of the land clearing on soybean farms in just the Cerrado area of Mato Grosso was illegal.

More broadly, a fifth of the soybeans exported to the European Union from Brazil’s Cerrado and Amazon regions combined and around 17% of the beef “may be contaminated by illegal deforestation,” according to a 2020 study by Brazilian and international scientists.

Dado Galdieri for HuffPost Alan Juliani, president of the Bahia soy producers association, at his farm in Roda Velha in Bahia state.

Many soybean farmers think they should be allowed to clear as many trees and as much native vegetation as they like, within Brazilian law. Why should Brazil preserve its forests, asked Cerrado farmer Alan Juliani, when Europe and the United States long since destroyed much of theirs?

Juliani’s family story mirrors the Cerrado’s development. His grandfather Alcides bought a farm in Bahia in northeastern Brazil in 1980, hoping that growing soybeans would help provide for his eight children. He was one of many pioneer farmers who moved from southern Brazil to the cheaper land of the Cerrado.

Life on Brazil’s soybean frontier was tough. “There was nowhere to buy parts, there were no shops, there was no power, there was no telephone,” Alan Juliani told HuffPost. “It was real suffering.” But things are different now. Today Juliani, 42, is a successful soybean farmer. He is president of Bahia’s branch of the soy producers association (APROSOJA) and farms nearly 15,000 acres in western Bahia, part of a frontier region known as Matopiba.

But not everybody in Brazilian government is ignoring the changes in such an important agricultural region. Worried researchers from Embrapa are developing tough new strains of soybeans. “Embrapa soybeans teams are looking for varieties more adapted to climate change because we are seeing more frequent droughts, more frequent excessively heavy rains,” said Alexandre Nepomuceno, the institute’s head of soybeans research.

Dado Galdieri for HuffPost Juliani inspects his soybean farm in the Cerrado.

Many of the soybeans grown by farmers like Juliani are bought by giant international companies ― including two U.S. corporations, Bunge and Cargill, which keep silos across the Cerrado.

As the Cerrado is being swallowed up by agriculture, these companies are coming under pressure to guarantee that the soybeans they trade were not grown on land that was deforested, either legally or illegally. Bunge has promised to eliminate all deforestation — including legal clearing — from its supply chain by 2025, and Cargill has vowed the same by 2030.

The U.S. nonprofit Mighty Earth has attempted to calculate how much land clearance the farms supplying companies like Cargill and Bunge carried out in 2019 and 2020 — and how much of that might have been illegal ― using satellite imagery and supply chain research.

“It is possible that producers can get permits to clear in these areas, but it’s very unlikely they have done. We present these cases to all the traders. If they come forward with documentation, we will exclude that record,” Sarah Lake, Mighty Earth’s global director for Latin America, told HuffPost.

Both Cargill and Bunge said they do not source from illegally cleared land.

“We will not source soy from farmers who clear land illegally or plant in protected areas,” said a spokesperson for Cargill. “This is outlined in our Soy Policy and we hold our suppliers accountable to complying with our expectations.”

A spokesperson for Bunge said the company “does not source soy from illegally deforested areas. ... Bunge monitors the occurrence of deforestation on direct supply farms, and blocks any farm that does not comply with environmental or labor legislation.” As to Mighty Earth’s report, the spokesperson added, “in all the cases linked to Bunge there was no connection with soy planted over deforested areas and sourcing to the company. Also, the report is based on past relationships, and not future ones.”

Dado Galdieri for HuffPost Silos sit scattered throughout the Bahia municipality of Luís Eduardo Magalhães.

But neither company monitors all of its Brazilian suppliers, and the devil is in the details.

Both corporations are part of the Soft Commodities Forum, a group of six food giants working to develop a soybean supply chain free of land conversion. As part of this forum, Cargill and Bunge monitor direct suppliers across 25 municipalities. “Direct suppliers” are farms selling directly to them, rather than indirectly through another farm or organization.

But they still don’t monitor all of their indirect suppliers, which in Cargill’s case supply 31% of its Brazilian soybeans (Bunge has not released that figure). “They are looking at less than half of the soy coming into their supply chain,” said Lake.

Nor is full monitoring likely to happen soon. “Traceability for indirect sources is a long journey,” the December 2020 Soft Commodities Forum report said.

Bunge and Cargill also continue to buy from at least one farm known to be involved in legal land clearing in the Cerrado. Both are customers of SLC Agrícola, a Brazilian company that said it legally cleared 5,200 hectares of land (12,850 acres) on just one Cerrado farm, called Fazenda Parceiro, in 2020. SLC Agrícola told HuffPost that it had “followed all the norms and regulations.”

Neither Cargill nor Bunge explained how doing business with a company still clearing Cerrado land would help them reach their zero-deforestation goals. “We can confirm that SLC Agrícola is not on any embargoed list,” said Cargill. A Bunge spokesperson said, “We have a time-bound plan with clear goals to reach deforestation-free supply chains.”

There is increasing international pressure on Brazil to do something about its environmental destruction. In January, French President Emmanuel Macron criticized Brazilian soy for its links to deforestation. He suggested Europe would start to grow its own soy, tweeting: “We are consistent with our ecological ambitions, we are fighting to grow soy in Europe!”

But farmers like Juliani insist they are not concerned. “Exports are going really well,” Juliani said. “The global price is very good. It is a very good moment.”

And while harvests continue to break records, farmers in the Cerrado seem unwilling to change course. “We produce legal soybeans for our whole world. And as Brazil is an agricultural frontier country, there is a lot more land still to be cleared,” said Juliani.

The Brazilian government predicts production for the 2020-2021 harvest will hit a record 133.8 million tons as China gobbles up most of the high-protein soybeans that Brazil produces.

Even if Europe ― which imported 13.7 million tons of soybean meal and raw soybeans from Brazil during the 2019-2020 harvest ― stops buying over environmental concerns, Brazil can just sell elsewhere, Juliani said. “China is not saying anything. They need our soybeans. And they will need much more,” he added.

But others in Brazilian agribusiness, including farmers’ leaders, are worried about the negative impact that the ongoing environmental destruction is having on their industry, said Daniel Nepstad, a U.S. ecologist who advises three state governments in the Cerrado and Amazon regions. “There is a very serious business concern in Brazil about the possibility of losing markets, losing partnerships, losing investors,” Nepstad said.

Pressure is also coming from retailers, food groups and investors in Brazil and abroad. Companies, nonprofits and other institutions that since 2017 have signed onto a Cerrado Manifesto, calling for immediate action to eliminate deforestation in the region, are turning the screws. In December 2020, more than 160 of them ― including McDonald’s, Walmart and U.K. supermarket chain Tesco ― signed a statement demanding that traders like Bunge and Cargill stop sourcing soybeans from Cerrado areas deforested after 2020. Abiove, the Brazilian soybean association that represents the big traders, refused those demands.

Some companies ― such as Bremnes Seashore, a big Norwegian salmon producer ― have announced they will stop buying Brazilian soy altogether. In February, French bank BNP Paribas said it would not finance companies, traders or farms that lack a strategy to achieve zero deforestation and full traceability of direct and indirect soy suppliers by 2025 at the latest. And leading European poultry producer LDC Group has just said it will request that importers “exclude soybeans from plots newly deforested or converted after [Jan. 1, 2020], in particular in the Cerrado in Brazil.”

“The European market is increasingly under pressure from consumers to address the deforestation in its supply chain,” said Lake of Mighty Earth.

Still, progress remains slow. In November, a joint investigation published in The Guardian and other media outlets found that Tesco and other U.K. stores were selling chickens fed on Cerrado soy supplied by Cargill that was linked to fires and 300 square miles of land clearance. Tesco is still selling the chickens. Cargill told The Guardian that its sourcing broke no rules, nor the company’s own policies.

Dado Galdieri for HuffPost An airplane sprays over soy fields behind native trees in the Cerrado.

One current proposal is to provide economic incentives to farmers to stop cutting down trees and vegetation in the Cerrado. Tesco has pledged £10 million ($13.8 million) to compensate farmers who promise not to deforest, even legally, as part of the Cerrado Funding Coalition. As yet, none of the money has been spent, a Tesco spokesman told HuffPost.

Payment for conservation is something that Nepstad also supports. The ecologist argues that compensating farmers to preserve land would meet a commitment made in Brazil’s Forest Code law that was never carried out. There is also precedent for this idea. In the 1990s, Costa Rica pioneered a program, funded by a carbon tax, that paid landowners to protect forests. Along with other conservation efforts, the program helped the country reverse deforestation trends.

Brazil does have a similar program, called Floresta+, developed by Bolsonaro’s predecessor Michel Temer in 2018. The initiative managed to raise $96 million from the United Nations-linked Green Climate Fund for deforestation reductions made during 2014 and 2015, which was paid out just after Bolsonaro took office in 2019. Bolsonaro’s government has since claimed the Floresta+ program as its own, announcing that the money will fund a pilot project for a wider conservation program. Asked if any payments have been made so far, the Environment Ministry did not reply.

Also, in a rare moment of agreement between environmentalist lawmakers and those linked to agribusiness, the Brazilian Congress approved a national policy to pay for environmental services in December.

But environmentalists and researchers say the Cerrado needs far more urgent protection. Tiago Reis, a Brazilian researcher for Trase and the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium, interviewed 127 soybean farmers in 2020. He believes soybean farmers should be legally obligated to install “ecological corridors” of native vegetation within their vast fields and barred from deforesting even legally. “There is sufficient degraded land where soy could expand. You really don’t need to clear more native land,” Reis said.

Lake said companies setting deadlines of 2025 and 2030 to end deforestation are still moving far too slowly to stem the rapid rates of destruction in this vital ecosystem. “In 10 years’ time,” she said, “there won’t be any areas left to clear.”

34,"['Editor', 'This New World']","Coal is the number-one single source for increasing global temperatures, with coal-fired electricity generation accounting for 30% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. And yet, scores of banks and institutional investors continue to pump money into supporting and expanding this fossil fuel industry, new research finds.

As of January 2021, institutional investors such as pension funds, asset managers and insurance companies around the world held investments worth more than $1 trillion in coal, with U.S. investors collectively holding 58% of the institutional investment in the global coal industry.

Commercial banks, meanwhile, have increased their funding of coal companies since the 2016 signing of the Paris climate agreement, in which countries pledged to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius.

The new research, released Thursday by Urgewald, Reclaim Finance and Rainforest Action Network along with 26 other nonprofits, examined the money flowing to 934 coal companies using information from financial databases. “This is the first time anyone has attempted to analyze commercial banks’ and institutional investors’ exposure to the entire coal industry,” said Katrin Ganswindt, the head of financial research at Urgewald.

The investment firm Vanguard is the largest institutional investor in coal, according to the research, with holdings of almost $86 billion. It’s followed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which holds more than $84 billion in coal investments, according to the research. These two U.S.-based investors together are responsible for 17% of the total institutional investment in the world’s coal industry.

These findings comes after a number of financial institutions in recent years announced new policies restricting their coal industry lending.

BlackRock, for example, has divested from companies making more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal for its actively-managed funds. A spokesperson for BlackRock said that “our conviction is that climate risk is investment risk,” but that the firm cannot divest when it comes to index funds, which track lists of companies.

For these funds, the spokesperson said, “We ask all companies to disclose their plan for alignment with a global net-zero economy by 2050. ... Where we do not see sufficient progress, we take voting action.”

A spokesperson for Vanguard said that most of the firm’s coal holdings were in index funds and that the firm engages with these companies: “We make clear our expectations that they pursue globally accepted climate risk mitigation targets such as those in the Paris Agreement and report on their short- and long-term progress toward meeting those goals. Where companies are not moving in line with market regulation or taking the necessary action to mitigate climate risk, we will take action.”

The researchers also examined lending and underwriting services by commercial banks. “What surprised me,” said Ganswindt, “is that, for banks, we cannot see a clear downward trend for overall [coal] financing.”

The total amount that commercial banks are funneling to coal companies through lending and underwriting services increased by 11% between 2016 and 2019, according to the research.

Japanese banks are the top coal lenders, providing $76 billion in coal financing between 2018 and 2020. “The coal policies adopted by Japanese banks are among the weakest in the world,” said Eri Watanabe from 350.org Japan, one of the other nonprofits behind the research. These policies are full of caveats, she said, and don’t rule out financing for companies still building new coal plants in countries such as Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Bill Estep/Lexington Herald-Leader/Tribune News Service/Getty Images Coal from an underground mine in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, pours off the end of a conveyor onto a pile used to load trucks for delivery in December 2018.

U.S. banks were the second biggest lenders, providing $68 billion to coal companies between 2018 and 2020. Citigroup was the leading U.S. funder with $13.5 billion in loans to coal companies over the last two years.

In April 2020, Citigroup committed to stop providing financial services for thermal coal mining by 2030. But the policy is limited, said Yann Louvel of Reclaim Finance, a nonprofit that tracks financial firms’ coal policies. “If you read the small print,” Louvel said, “the phase-out only applies to companies that generate at least 25% of their revenues from thermal coal mining, thus letting large diversified coal miners slip out of the net.”

Citigroup declined to comment.

U.S. commercial banks are also among the biggest underwriters of coal projects in the world, according to the report, second only to Chinese banks. U.S. banks supplied $104 billion in underwriting services to the coal industry over the past two years.

“These numbers provide a sobering reality check on banks’ climate commitments,” said Louvel. Reclaim Finance has analyzed 237 financial institutions globally with coal policies and said that only 18 have strong policies that significantly restrict coal funding.

The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that coal must be phased out by 2050 if the world is to have a chance of tackling the climate crisis.

To achieve this, “the bulk of coal financing and investment must be ended before 2030,” said Paddy McCully, climate and energy program director at Rainforest Action Network. “This is the decade that counts.”

The nonprofits behind the research are calling for urgent action through robust and immediate coal exclusion policies and government intervention. “Now is the time for the finance industry to act,” said Louvel. “A speedy exit from coal finance and investment is not only doable and desirable; it is a question of survival.”","['investment', 'coal', 'banks', 'institutional', 'pouring', 'billion', 'climate', 'billions', 'investors', 'policies', 'companies', 'financial', 'research']",2021-02-25 00:00:06-05:00

BISCAYNE BAY, ISLAMORADA AND SARASOTA BAY, Florida — It’s winter in Miami. Many New Englanders come here to escape the snow, although none opt for snorkeling on this windy January morning. We pull off the side of the highway with specific instructions about where to find a particular species of seagrass from Laura Eldredge, manager of the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserves.

After slipping into wetsuits, we jump in a kayak and paddle into Tuttle Basin, which is lined by highways and high-rise buildings. More than 6 million people live here in the Miami metropolitan area, the most densely populated part of Florida.

We’re searching for a tiny patch of Johnson’s seagrass (Halophila johnsonii) in the shallow, tea-colored water. Despite Eldredge’s precise directions, we can’t find it. The leaves only grow to one inch long and boat traffic is stirring up the bay’s fine sediments. We can barely see our own hands under the surface — the turbid water makes it both difficult to snorkel and hard for the seagrass to photosynthesize and grow.

This elusive, tiny marine plant is at risk, threatened by human activities such as dredging, scarring from boat propellers and pollution from coastal development. It is the first and only marine plant to be listed under the Endangered Species Act, where it’s classified as “threatened.” It may have the most limited distribution of any seagrass on Earth, found only in lagoons along 125 miles of Florida’s southeast coast.

Jennifer Adler for HuffPost Turtle grass and sunlight in the Lignumvitae Key Aquatic Preserve, adjacent to Islamorada in the Upper Florida Keys.

Florida has the most diverse seagrass meadows in the U.S. The state is home to 2.5 million acres of seagrasses, made up of seven different species.

Around the world, 58 species of seagrasses hug the coastline of every continent except Antarctica. These underwater flowering plants — more closely related to lilies than grasses — are often overlooked and underappreciated, but these “hidden forests” have an outsized impact when it comes to tackling climate change and supporting other marine ecosystems.

Seagrasses occupy less than 0.2% of the seafloor but represent up to 10% of the ocean’s capacity to store carbon, known as “blue carbon.” Although the amount they can store depends on the species and location, some seagrasses can store twice as much carbon as the world’s temperate and tropical forests. They also help keep the water clear by capturing sediments. They cycle nutrients and provide important habitats for fish, crustaceans and shellfish.

But these underwater meadows are among the most threatened ecosystems on Earth ― at risk from climate change, coastal development and nutrient pollution, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, which enter the ocean from wastewater treatment plants, stormwater, agriculture and other sources. These pollutants cause phytoplankton and algae to grow more rapidly, reducing water clarity and making it harder for seagrasses to get enough light to photosynthesize.

Jennifer Adler for HuffPost Seagrass near the Sands of Islamorada Ocean Front Hotel, Islamorada, Florida. Coastal development, and the pollution it causes, is a big threat to seagrass ecosystems.

Normally, healthy seagrass meadows are self-reinforcing, meaning they help create conditions that make it more favorable for them to survive. They capture sediments, which makes the water more clear, they oxygenate the water, and they share nutrients and carbohydrates with other seagrasses through root systems that connect the plants underground.

“If you get a stress to the system, you start to erode its resilience,” said Savanna Barry, who has been studying seagrasses in Florida for more than 10 years and works at the UF/IFAS Nature Coast Biological Station. “When our human systems push those buttons too often, then the seagrasses start to thin out and die.” As the seagrass dies, the sediment once trapped by its roots clouds the water and blocks light.

Worldwide, 10 seagrass species are at elevated risk of extinction and three qualify as endangered. Between 1980 and 2006, seagrass habitat globally disappeared at a rate of about 42 square miles per year, five times faster than the rate of loss during the previous 40 years.

The die-off of seagrasses presents a huge threat to the ocean ecosystem as well as to fisheries, tourism and jobs that depend on the seas.

“There definitely are true tipping points in seagrass meadows where you really can push it too far and get yourself in a situation where it’s really hard for the seagrass to come back,” said Barry.

It’s not that the changes are necessarily irreversible in themselves, she explained, “it’s just that it takes millions, if not billions, of dollars and decades to do it. Once you lose seagrass, you’re in for an extensive and long-term battle to get it back.”

Dave Tomasko has studied seagrasses in Florida for almost 40 years and is now the director of the nonprofit Sarasota Bay Estuary Program, which helps protect and restore the bay off the central west coast of Florida.

“Our general approach to managing seagrasses is managing water quality,” he said, so seagrasses can get the abundant light they rely on for photosynthesis. The key to this, said Tomasko, is reducing the amount of nutrients being washed into the bay from stormwater and wastewater.

The Sarasota Bay Estuary Program collaborates with the local government, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and the water management districts to upgrade wastewater treatment plants and add stormwater retrofits, such as retention ponds, rain gardens and green roofs, which slow down polluted stormwater and let it seep into the ground naturally, rather than running directly into streams, lakes and oceans.

But Sarasota Bay is what Tomasko calls “a success story sliding backwards.”

“Between 1988 and 2014,” he said, “we had a big nutrient reduction and seagrass coverage actually increased to levels above what it was in 1950.” During those years, Sarasota County consolidated around 70 smaller wastewater treatment plants, many of which were struggling to operate, into a series of larger plants. This, combined with the removal of thousands of septic tanks and banning fertilizer use on lawns during the rainy season, significantly reduced the amount of nitrogen entering the bay.

Unfortunately, a lot of this progress was undone between 2013 and 2018. During these five years, a wastewater treatment plant in Sarasota County released more than 800 million gallons of sewage that were not properly treated, which severely increased nutrient loads in the bay. At the same time, there was increased rainfall as well as population growth in the area, which stressed aging infrastructure with more waste to treat, store and dispose of.

Jennifer Adler for HuffPost A propeller scar from a boat in a seagrass meadow composed of turtle grass in the Lignumvitae Key Aquatic Preserve, Islamorada, Florida.

In the southern part of Sarasota Bay, Tomasko said most of the increase in seagrass coverage is now gone.

As coastal development continues, Floridians often don’t think about their impacts on the hidden meadows beneath the sea’s surface. “We build bridges, we have tall buildings and beautiful apartments,” said Tomasko, “but we haven’t maintained a wastewater infrastructure commensurate with the population requirements.”

Even in regions that are currently less populated, seagrasses are still at risk. As climate refugees are predicted to move from south to north Florida to escape rising seas, more remote areas are going to have to contend with an increasing population, which brings issues with wastewater, stormwater runoff, and fertilized lawns that have historically plagued more developed parts of the state.

Barry, who’s based in Cedar Key in Florida’s Big Bend region, a few hours north of Sarasota, is worried. “We’re not out of the woods just because we’re less developed,” she said. “Every bad decision that’s made along the way in terms of nutrient management ... seagrasses are going to be the end receiver.”

Even without large populations on the coast, seagrasses are downstream of rivers that pass through agricultural fields and developments and carry these nutrients out to the ocean.

Jennifer Adler for HuffPost A small-spine sea star hangs onto a blade of turtle grass in Holmes Beach, Florida.

The Big Bend area is home to the second-largest seagrass bed in North America. In order to help protect these vulnerable areas of seagrass, Florida passed a bill to create the Nature Coast Aquatic Preserve — the state’s first aquatic preserve in more than 30 years. Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed the bill into law in June 2020. The preserve will have a management plan and state managers who will oversee and protect 400,000 acres of seagrass meadows, spanning about 800 square miles off Florida’s west coast.

This region is known for manatee-watching, scalloping and fishing, all of which rely on seagrasses to survive. Seagrass-dependent activities generate approximately $600 million for the tricounty region (Citrus, Hernando and Pasco counties) annually, provide more than 10,000 jobs, and support more than 500 businesses, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts.

More than 100 businesses, nine state and national recreational fishing and marine industry organizations, the Citrus and Hernando county commissions, and The Pew Charitable Trusts backed creation of the preserve.

“The Nature Coast Aquatic Preserve is a win for the economy and environment that will safeguard valuable marine resources and support fishing, scalloping, and tourism businesses for generations to come,” said Holly Binns, director of The Pew Charitable Trusts’ ocean and coastal conservation work in the Southeast.

Binns adds that the need for water quality protections in Florida is growing more urgent with increasing nutrient pollution. Recently, red tides and other harmful algae blooms on both coasts, fueled by nutrient-laden runoff, have taken a severe toll on fishing and tourism businesses.

One of the most-cited seagrass success stories is Tampa Bay. Between 1950 and the 1980s, the bay lost 46% of its seagrasses. But since the late 1980s, the Tampa Bay area has reduced the amount of nitrogen entering the bay by 90% and more seagrass currently exists than at its peak in 1950. Seagrasses now cover 40,000 acres, almost three times the area of Manhattan.

Starting in the 1980s, stricter legal standards were applied to wastewater treatment plants in the Tampa Bay area and St. Petersburg started a large-scale reclaimed wastewater program, which uses treated wastewater on lawns and golf courses. During the same decade, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection developed more stringent requirements for stormwater systems, which reduced the amount of nutrients and sediments flowing into the bay from urban areas.

While Tampa shows the value and potential of seagrass restoration, the struggles to halt seagrass decline in areas like Sarasota Bay and Biscayne Bay reveal just how hard it is to bring back these vital ecosystems once they’ve been lost.

Between 2016 and 2018, scientists from the University of South Florida and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission visited 33 seagrass restoration sites around the state, some of which were more than three decades old. They found that almost 90% of the sites continued to support seagrass but when compared with natural seagrass beds, these restored beds were more sparse, with an average of one-third less coverage of seagrass.

Protecting seagrasses in the first place is a much better strategy and this requires buy-in from everyone: community residents, government, businesses that rely on the water and businesses that contribute to water pollution.

Increasing awareness of the importance of seagrass ecosystems is one of the greatest challenges for its conservation. Seagrasses suffer from not being as well-known or appreciated as their more charismatic marine cousins, such as coral reefs and mangroves, despite being just as threatened.

Jennifer Adler for HuffPost A piece of dislodged seagrass floats beneath the surface in the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve, Florida.

There is some hope that citizen science projects can help increase this awareness. The Sarasota Bay Estuary Foundation coordinates citizen science efforts to monitor the seagrass. Tomasko said these volunteers can help fill crucial data gaps in the organization’s monitoring and restoration projects.

The foundation also has a board of more than 50 local stakeholders that Tomasko oversees for the Sarasota Bay Estuary. It includes residents, scientists, managers, and members of local and state government. “It’s not just scientists and engineers but policymakers — we have the heads of utilities; we have elected officials. We have to bring them into it. Otherwise, we’re just talking amongst ourselves.”

Florida’s seagrass meadows need to become something that Floridians know are disappearing and want to protect. “People seem to generally know the [sea]grass is probably important,” said Barry, “but they really can’t name any reason above that fish live there. There’s not a general understanding of what seagrasses are doing for us more broadly or that decline in water quality is their main threat. There’s definitely no one opposed to seagrass but there are also not a lot of advocates for it.”

Of course, it’s not just Florida where seagrasses need protection. Globally, hundreds of millions of people directly rely on seagrass for their food and livelihood but worldwide loss of seagrasses is estimated at 2% to 5% per year — 4 to 10 times the rate of loss for tropical forests. “Public awareness of these losses, as well as understanding of the processes and causes of loss,” wrote marine ecologist Carlos Duarte and colleagues in a 2008 article in Estuarine and Coastal Sciences, “is necessary to motivate effective management and protect or restore these ecosystems.”

Jennifer Adler for HuffPost Ian Segebarth photographs a seagrass meadow composed of turtle grass in the Lignumvitae Key Aquatic Preserve.

Back in Miami’s Tuttle Basin, we paddled the kayak upwind toward the boat ramp, discouraged about not finding the Johnson’s seagrass. Jet Skis zoomed around and power boats blaring bass-heavy music practically swamped us with their wakes. A female manatee and her calf surfaced to breathe near the kayak, but when I carefully slid into the water to photograph them swimming in the seagrass beds, the water was too dark to see them clearly, even from a foot away. To see the seagrasses that were there — turtle grass, manatee grass and shoal grass — I had to dive close enough for it to touch my mask.

From above, the view is equally disheartening. Scars from boats crisscross the seagrasses like sand drawings with a stick at the beach. These scars rarely heal, especially in popular boating areas — for some seagrasses, it’s estimated it could take 60 years for them to heal. In places like Biscayne Bay, which has lost more than 21 square miles of seagrass over the past decade, this is time they may not have.

36,['On Assignment For Huffpost'],"The Ikea store in Queens, New York, which opened on Jan. 14, marked a decided departure for the iconic home furnishings brand. Located in the Rego Park Shopping Center, the 115,000-square-foot open layout ― a new, smaller format for Ikea ― is divided into core areas of the home, offering small-space solutions tailored to city living. Rooms are thoughtfully merchandised with easily portable accessories like lamps and throw pillows that customers can take with them on the bus or subway, both of which are a block away — a key factor in choosing the store’s location, given that more than half of city residents use public transportation.

Digital stations allow shoppers to self-pay and arrange furniture delivery for bigger pieces for a flat fee of $49. The company is working to make all last-mile deliveries in New York City by electric vehicle, according to Jennifer Keesson, country sustainability manager for Ikea U.S. — a test run on the way to making the last mile of its more than 2 million annual home deliveries nationwide zero emissions by 2025.

The Swedish powerhouse set out 80 years ago “to create a better everyday life for the many people” — as its motto goes — by putting sleek, stylish home furnishings within the budgets of the masses, and became a $35.4 billion (2020 revenues) market force in the process. And just as the brand is widely credited with democratizing design, it’s now moving to make sustainable living the norm rather than the exception, with a sprawling strategy that’s wildly ambitious in scope.

Ikea’s overarching goal is to become “climate positive” by 2030 — reducing more greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) than its entire value chain emits. It plans to do this while still growing its business by designing new products, moving into new markets and building dozens, perhaps hundreds, of new stores in that time. The company is charging ahead with plans to open 50 more stores (of various sizes and formats) in 2021 alone.

Expanding its retail footprint on a warming planet may seem to fly directly in the face of Ikea’s plan to reduce its colossal climate footprint. In the last year, moves to decrease energy use across the business, from manufacturing to what it serves in its restaurants, have reduced its climate footprint per product sold by 7%, the company estimates. Meeting its 2030 target while selling ever more will mean cutting the average climate footprint per product by 70%.

Given that Ikea emitted the equivalent of 24.9 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2019 — accounting for 0.1% of the world’s GHG emissions that year — it’s a Herculean undertaking that encompasses virtually every element of its business, from the materials it sources through product manufacturing and transport. Emissions reductions will also come from efforts to pull carbon out of the atmosphere (without the use of carbon offsets) and influence supplier and customer behavior.

The products we put on the market, the materials we choose, and where we source them from are critical to us becoming climate positive. Pia Heidenmark Cook, chief sustainability officer of Ingka Group

Making products last longer, and giving old products second lives, is a central pillar of its climate ambitions: Ikea aims to become a “100% circular business” by 2030. That means creating home goods that not only meet Ikea’s definition of “democratic design” — affordable, high-quality, sustainable, stylish and functional — but also can be reused, refurbished, recycled or remanufactured into new items.

Materials contribute the most to Ikea’s overall climate footprint, followed by the use of products in customer homes. Squeezing carbon savings out of those budgets poses the greatest hurdles toward meeting its ambitious targets, which were set to align with the Paris climate accord goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

“An increasing number of companies have said they’ll be climate positive by 2040 or 2050, but relatively few have said 2030,” said Andrew Winston, a corporate sustainability strategist and author of “The Big Pivot.” “Ikea’s challenge is also much more complicated because they manufacture tons of different products — unlike a company like Google, which has also set incredibly aggressive goals.”

The sprawling infrastructure and commercial leverage that enables the company to manufacture and sell millions of products is exactly what Ikea is banking on to realize its climate goals.

“Obviously the consumption model of the 1900s that we were part of will not work in the future, because we’re consuming more than the planet can provide,” said Ingka Group CEO Jesper Brodin on a Harvard Business Review podcast last December. Ingka Group is the largest of 12 strategic partners in Ikea’s franchise system, operating 380 Ikea stores around the world.

“I love mass production,” said Brodin, “because if you put it in the right aspect, you can scale up change so much better and faster. If you can scale something that’s climate-positive, that’s probably the best and fastest way of doing it — and bring the cost down so sustainability doesn’t become something that’s only for those who can afford it.”

Seeing The Forest For The Trees

Arguably few companies, particularly in the retail industry, have Ikea’s vision and knack for innovation. Founded in 1943 by the late Ingvar Kamprad — the name is an acronym of his initials, his family farm (Elmtaryd), and his birthplace (Agunnaryd) — it quickly became known for low prices. Chagrined competitors tried to pressure suppliers to boycott the brand, driving Kamprad to start designing products in-house and thinking early about moving beyond his home market.

Ikea shifted to flat-pack, self-assembly products in 1953 to minimize shipping costs and damage to mail-order deliveries. In 1970, the first self-service area was opened at Ikea’s flagship store near Stockholm, which allowed customers to walk out with flat-pack furniture in hand to assemble at home. The debut of Ikea’s first store outside of Scandinavia, in Switzerland, in 1973 set the stage for international expansion: Ikea is now the world’s largest home furnishings business, with nearly 530 stores (including test formats and planning studios) in more than 50 countries.

The seeds of Ikea’s shift to sustainability were planted (literally) in 1998, with the launch of the “Sow a Seed” Foundation, which sought to rehabilitate large swaths of rainforest lost to logging and forest fires in Malaysian Borneo. Over the next two decades, Ikea funded the replanting of 3 million trees across 31,000 now-protected acres of rainforest.

Stacy Funderburke In January, Ingka Group bought 10,840 acres of forested land in southeast Georgia. It now owns 136,000 forest acres in five states.

Sustainable forestry has long been a key focus of the brand, for good reason. Ikea uses wood in 60% of its products. Last year, it used just under 671 million cubic feet of wood (enough to fill 18 Empire State Buildings) in home furnishings and packaging, most of it from Poland, Russia, Belarus, Sweden and Germany. About 12% of it was recycled and nearly all the rest was certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, a nonprofit group that promotes responsible forestry (Ikea is a founding member), meaning its harvesting did not contribute to deforestation.

Ikea still runs into criticism from time to time. Last year, the company was accused of illegally sourcing wood from Ukraine; a third-party independent investigation found no evidence of such timber in its supply chain, attributing the allegations to ambiguity surrounding the law concerning certain forest management practices. FSC is now working to resolve the issue.

Wood as a resource is under threat from deforestation, wildfires, pests and other climate change impacts. The brand’s commitment to sustainable forest management is intended to ensure that its most critical raw material remains in sufficient supply. It also aims to enhance biodiversity, support those whose livelihoods are forest-dependent and protect vital carbon-sequestering trees. A big chunk of the company’s emissions reductions rely on keeping carbon locked up in the plants and soils of healthy forests.

To that end, Ikea invests heavily in forestland, where the company can reap carefully managed timber. Earlier this month, Ingka Group announced its acquisition of nearly 11,000 forested acres in southeast Georgia from The Conservation Fund, assuming its legally binding obligations to protect the land from fragmentation, restore trees and protect wildlife. The company now owns 136,000 acres of forest across five states, and some 613,000 acres combined in the U.S. and Europe.

Material Change

“Seventy percent of our footprint comes from materials,” said Pia Heidenmark Cook, Ingka Group’s chief sustainability officer. “So the products we put on the market, the materials we choose and where we source them from are critical.”

Ikea is taking a close look at its entire supply chain, said Cook, with the goal of using only recycled or renewable materials (like sustainably sourced wood and cotton) in its over 9,500 products by 2030. Today 10% of products contain recycled material, such as plastic and polyester, and 60% contain renewable materials.

The company has so far mapped out how to achieve half its materials footprint reduction goals for 2030 and has to figure out how to get the rest of the way there.

In the December podcast, Brodin called raw materials the most challenging part of the sustainability equation, noting that materials R&D has been one of the brand’s top investment priorities for nearly a decade.

“In terms of material innovation, the majority of investment is connected to our sustainability agenda — to find new materials that have a smaller climate or water footprint than what we use today,” said Cook.

The perception of Ikea as a mass producer of stuff that doesn’t last very long has probably been its biggest Achilles' heel. Andrew Winston, corporate sustainability strategist

Laminated veneer lumber (LVL) is one material showing promise. A relatively new engineered product, it comprises multiple thin layers of wood glued together and cuts down on wood consumption by up to 40%. Its strength is comparable to metal in some applications, making it a potentially viable substitute for steel and aluminum, which have a high climate footprint due to their energy-intensive production process.

Another project explores using rice straw — a harvesting residue that’s typically burned and contributes to air pollution in places like northern India — as a new renewable material source.

Ikea has also partnered with clothing retailer H&M and forest products manufacturer Stora Enso to invest in Tree To Textile, a company that transforms wood cellulose into a sustainable textile fiber that could potentially serve as an alternative to cotton, Ikea’s second-most-used raw material behind wood. Last year, the brand used nearly 142,000 tons of the water-intensive crop — 0.5% of cotton production worldwide.

So far, alternative materials are still in testing phases or limited use. Ikea’s rice-straw product prototypes debuted as the FÖRÄNDRING (“change” in Swedish) collection of rugs, bowls and baskets at stores in India last year, with limited volumes in a few European markets.

Should the company determine these new materials are viable, it will take years to update designs, adapt supply chains and bring production to scale. But the advantage of Ikea’s size and clout means that if the company does identify any breakthrough renewable materials, it could push suppliers to get on board.

“Ikea is fairly unique in its ability to tell a potential supplier, ‘If you can’t meet our terms, we’ll find someone else who will,’” said Tom Eggert, a senior lecturer on business sustainability at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “Whether it’s a wood alternative or plant-based plastics or something else entirely, they have the buying power to create a market where one may not yet exist.”

Inter IKEA Systems B.V. Ikea's alternative meatball made with plant-based proteins is part of its climate mission.

While cheap sofas and tables are the company’s bread and butter, the brand is one of the world’s largest food sellers: 680 million customers visited its food outlets in 2019. It sells a billion of its signature Swedish meatballs a year.

But meat is an ecological nightmare — livestock production accounts for more than 14% of total global greenhouse emissions and is a leading cause of deforestation. So Ikea is retooling its menu. The company has sold over 5 million veggie hot dogs since unveiling them in 2018. Last August, it introduced the HUVUDROLL plant ball, an alternative to its iconic meatball. With ingredients like pea protein and potatoes, it mimics meat’s taste and texture (unlike the brand’s veggie balls, which debuted in 2015), with a climate footprint that’s only 4% of the beef-and-pork original.

The company aims to make 50% of its restaurant entrees plant-based by 2025, and 80% of them non-red meat (of animals raised for food, cows and pigs are the biggest GHG contributors). The brand’s packaged food will also be 80% plant-based within five years.

Ikea’s other not-so-small side hustle is helping eliminate fossil fuels from its retail operations and production: The company is striving for 100% renewable energy across its entire value chain by 2030 — including helping secure 100% renewable electricity for its nearly 1,600 suppliers. Ikea has been investing in solutions like solar and wind farms around the world since 2009. Its clean energy portfolio now includes 547 wind turbines and two solar farms in 14 countries, and more than 920,000 solar panels on the roofs of Ikea stores and warehouses.

Last year, for the first time, Ingka Group generated more renewable energy — by a third — than it consumed globally in retail and distribution operations.

“Ikea is very much ahead of the curve in retail,” said Winston. “They were one of the biggest renewable energy purchasers before the big tech companies started their buying sprees.”

Widening The Circle

In order to realize its vision of becoming 100% circular by 2030 — eliminating waste by keeping materials and finished products in use — Ikea must not only make products out of recycled and recyclable materials, but also convince its hundreds of millions of customers to recycle or reuse them.

“A truly circular economy approach is going to have to deal with end of life of products in a totally revolutionary way compared with their current business model,” said ecological economist Tim Jackson, author of the upcoming book “Post Growth: Life After Capitalism.”

The company is exploring how to entice customers to do their part.

During its #BuyBackFriday campaign late last year — conceived as an alternative to traditional Black Friday marketing blitzes — Ikea stores in 27 countries offered to buy back and resell thousands of used home furnishings. Customers received vouchers worth between 30% and 50% of their item’s original price, depending on its condition. (Anything that couldn’t be resold was recycled or donated to COVID-19 community outreach projects.) Down the road, as the company develops its methods, a bought-back chair could be stripped to its frame, polished, painted, and reshaped into a new chair.

Ikea is turning their “as-is” sections — where last year, 30.5 million discontinued and seasonal items, floor samples and customer returns were sold at discounted prices — into “circular hubs.” Customers can bargain hunt for secondhand furnishings while picking up tips on fixing, cleaning or hacking their Ikea products. There are plans to launch hubs in half of Ikea’s stores by the end of the year.

HENRIK MILL/Inter IKEA Systems B.V. Ikea opened its first secondhand pop-up store in Eskilstuna, Sweden, in November 2020. The company plans to put ""circular hubs,"" where it will sell reused or recycled products, in half its locations by the end of 2021.

Ikea’s first entirely secondhand store, a six-month test project, debuted in Eskilstuna, Sweden, last November.

“The perception of Ikea as a mass producer of stuff that doesn’t last very long has probably been its biggest Achilles’ heel,” Winston said. “This relatively new effort to change the lifecycle of their products by refurbishing, reselling, or entirely recycling them is probably one of the most important things that they’re doing.”

Jackson put a fine point on it: “#BuyBackFriday was a symbolic gesture. It needs to be an everyday reality.”

Cook says Ikea’s challenge “is to make sustainable living mainstream.” The company has had some past success. Back in 2015, when the most popular alternatives to inefficient incandescent light bulbs were halogens and compact fluorescent lamps, Ikea switched all its lighting products to light-emitting diodes (LEDs), believing that it could build an economy of scale and make LEDs a commercial success. The bulbs sold for about $7 at the time; they now cost less than $1 each and Ikea sold 56 million of them in 2019.

“In general, we are always trying to support the education of our customers [on] how to live a more sustainable and a healthier life at home,” Keesson said.

It’s reasonable to question how any company with a business model based on selling more and more stuff can expand in a truly sustainable way. Some argue that with a burgeoning global middle class on the rise and eager to spend their disposable income, we need companies that will make the effort to stay within the limits of what the planet can provide.

“Demand will continue to grow as more and more people emerge from extreme poverty, and others move from poverty into the middle class,” Eggert said. “They’re going to want the same things the rest of the world has — affordable tables, chairs, all the things that Ikea sells. And Ikea says it’s going to meet that demand as sustainably as possible. Isn’t that better than some of the other alternatives out there?”

37,"[""Senior Women'S Reporter""]","If you’re a woman, you probably recognize that facial expression.

You know the one I’m talking about. The face you make when a man — usually older, usually more powerful — gets a little too … touchy. The look that threads the needle between “Fuck off” and “Thank you for this pleasant interaction, sir.” The look that says, “Please stop doing that, I feel extremely uncomfortable,” and also telegraphs that you’re not trying to escalate the situation. You are, after all, a younger woman.

It is this face that a friend captured Anna Ruch making the moment she said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo grabbed her cheeks and asked, “Can I kiss you?” at a wedding in 2019.

Breaking: A third woman has accused Cuomo of over-the-line behavior. Incredibly, a photographer caught the moment, and this look on her face: https://t.co/NnKCs1Y7WF pic.twitter.com/Smr4hNiKKp — Jodi Kantor (@jodikantor) March 2, 2021

Ruch, now 33, is the third woman to come forward with a story of nonconsensual, sexually inappropriate behavior at the hands of the governor, a man long known for his bullying and self-aggrandizement. Two former female aides have also accused Cuomo of sexual harassment. All three women are decades younger than him.

Ruch told The New York Times that she first met Cuomo at the aforementioned wedding reception back in September 2019. Ruch said that almost immediately after being introduced to her, Cuomo “put his hand on [her] lower back.” And when she removed it, “the governor remarked that she seemed ‘aggressive’ and placed his hands on her cheeks,” according to the Times. “He asked if he could kiss her, loudly enough for a friend standing nearby to hear.”

Ruch ultimately “pulled away as the governor drew closer,” but his lips made contact with her cheek.

The incident left her feeling “confused and shocked and embarrassed,” she told the Times.

The photograph of Ruch and Cuomo is remarkable — not for its aesthetic quality, but for the casual horror that it captures: a moment that feels almost common, but one that we are rarely privy to except in the shadows of our own memories as women. It’s remarkable precisely because it freezes in time an interaction that feels anything but.

In the photo, Cuomo stands over her, his hands wrapped tightly around her face. You can almost feel her in motion, trying to pull back. Her face is contorted into a strained half-smile, and her eyes are open in recognition of what’s about to happen. Her hands are hidden behind the governor’s arms in the picture, and I found myself wondering if she was contemplating pushing his hands off of her cheeks at that very moment. I wondered if she felt as stunned as her facial expression suggests.

There’s a reason New York state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi, herself a young woman, tweeted, “The photo in this article speaks for itself.”

Women are taught, subtly and overtly, to de-escalate interactions with men that violate their boundaries but may not cause overt physical harm. We freeze and wait for it to be over. We uncomfortably smile. We back away. We nod while shifting our faces away from their lips or moving our hips away from their hands. We try to assert our agency in the cracks of their domineering.

Often, we end up feeling like we don’t have agency at all.

“I didn’t have a choice in that matter,” Ruch told the Times, explaining why the incident had left her rattled. “I didn’t have a choice in his physical dominance over me at that moment. And that’s what infuriates me.”","['recognize', 'times', 'away', 'moment', 'face', 'hands', 'told', 'horror', 'gov', 'casual', 'york', 'women', 'woman', 'cuomo', 'captures', 'ruch']",2021-03-02 17:01:26-05:00
38,['Reporter'],"Rogelio V. Solis/AP Lamar Jackson, left, stacks bottled water brought by Mac Epps of Mississippi Move at a senior residence in Jackson, Mississippi, on Feb. 22, 2021. Rising temperatures have melted the snow and ice in Mississippi, but tens of thousands of people still had little or no water service.

Frigid temperatures and torrential snowfall have largely left the South after a cold front gripped the region weeks ago, but some cities are still facing dire infrastructure failures caused by the cold and their state’s lack of preparation.

Most of the people suffering the most untenable circumstances ― including a now weekslong water shortage in Mississippi ― are in predominantly Black and brown communities, and their experiences offer a grim look at the reality of racial inequality under the worsening global climate crisis.

When the extreme cold first touched the South in mid-February, Texas officials ― specifically, Texas Republicans ― were roundly criticized for their long-standing opposition to weatherizing the state’s power supply, a progressive energy priority. But widespread infrastructure failures during and after the cold front weren’t confined to Texas.

In recent days, Jackson, Mississippi, has also come into national focus as some parts of the majority-Black city enter day 13 of a water shortage caused by main breaks. Jackson is nearly 80% Black and has nearly 170,000 residents. Those using the city’s water system have been on a boil water advisory for the past week, meaning the city has advised them that water main breaks caused by the cold have left some areas with no water, low water pressure or potentially toxic material traveling through the pipes. Officials in the state and private donors have been distributing bottled water to help residents weather the shortage.

Rogelio V. Solis/AP Mississippi Army National Guard Sgt. Chase Toussaint fills five-gallon buckets with nonpotable water at the New Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church parking lot on March 1, 2021. Water for flushing toilets was being distributed at seven sites in Mississippi's capital more than 10 days after winter storms wreaked havoc on the city's water system, which is still struggling to maintain consistent water pressure, authorities said.

Just as in Texas, the cold has left Jackson’s infrastructure crumbling, reigniting historic debates over energy, climate and race in an agriculture-dependent state whose predominantly white power brokers wield control over much of the land.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba (D) said on NBC Monday afternoon that his city’s water mains are “not meant to withstand weather in the teens” and that weatherizing them costs “hundreds of millions of dollars, of which the city of Jackson does not have in its coffers.”

Lumumba called on the Mississippi legislature and Republican Gov. Tate Reeves to allocate funds to support Jackson’s faltering water system, and he condemned a veto Reeves issued last year blocking legislation proposed to help Jacksonians pay for their water bills. Lumumba said Monday the governor’s veto and some lawmakers’ resistance to improving the water system is impacting the recovery effort now.

“We are in a reactive mode where we’re trying to fix the bike while we’re riding it,” he said.

Lumumba recently called the crisis an “act of God” and defended his administration’s handling of the ongoing water shortage on Monday. Reeves, meanwhile, said Jackson would be provided with tankers of nonpotable water to “jumpstart the system.”

Last Tuesday, Reeves dispatched the National Guard to Jackson, saying troops would “complete the mission” to restore clean water in the city. In the past week, Reeves also floated the possibility that his administration could take the controversial step of giving Mississippi state control over Jackson’s water system.","['jackson', 'hitting', 'continues', 'cold', 'crisis', 'city', 'state', 'reeves', 'water', 'hardest', 'black', 'weekslong', 'mississippi', 'residents', 'left', 'system', 'texas']",2021-03-01 20:03:15-05:00
39,[],"To put it simply, Felicia D. Henderson has the range.



The TV producer-writer-director extraordinaire has spent the last few decades writing jokes for Steve Urkel on the long-running sitcom “Family Matters,” crafting new diary entries for Mo-to-tha-E-to-tha on “Moesha” and finessing feminist storylines into episodes of “Sister, Sister.” For fans of TV nostalgia and aspiring writers, Henderson is the creative genius you want to chat with for hours on end about the Black sitcom heyday of the 1990s.



She is also a premier example of what it looks like to ride Hollywood’s ever-bumpy waves and pivot at a perfect inflection point. By 2000, as networks started pulling back from investing in brand-new Black sitcoms, Henderson had landed the top spot as showrunner and executive producer of “Soul Food,” a Showtime TV follow-up to the 1997 blockbuster hit about the close-knit Joseph family in Chicago. At the time, there had never been a successful television drama centered around a Black family. (CBS shows “Under One Roof” and “City of Angels” only lasted one season apiece.) “Soul Food” was a hit for the network and garnered several NAACP Image Awards during its five-season run.



In the years that followed, Henderson produced episodes of “The Punisher,” “Empire,” “Fringe,” “Gossip Girl” and “Everybody Hates Chris.” She was also a writer, director and executive producer for the too-short-lived BET series “The Quad,” a drama set at the fictional historically Black college Georgia A&M University, in 2017.

“Henderson is the creative genius you want to chat with for hours on end about the Black sitcom heyday of the 1990s.”

Henderson’s list of credits may at times seem like a random collection of writing jobs and producer gigs. But a deeper look reveals a keen eye toward stories that center family dynamics and strong Black women who find ways to deal with all of their mess.

“Whether it’s sci-fi or supernatural or action, I love family elements or building a family if one doesn’t exist,” she told me over video chat in January. “That’s a theme probably in all of my work. Family, in my personal life, is everything. And in my creative life, I love writing about family in comedies and dramas and every genre.”

Her own lived experience has colored the way she tells stories — she’s one of six girls, in a family of eight siblings. She grew up loving comic books, and calls herself a “researchaholic,” ready to dig into whatever is next and be perfectly prepared to face any obstacles. (She has gone back to school twice to make sure her skill set is up to par.) Yet Henderson, 59, says her trajectory in the TV industry had less to do with her own planning and preparation and more to do with entering open doors feeling grateful to be able to do the best job she possibly can. And she takes that approach with young creators coming up behind her, providing a master class in generosity and kindness while keeping her sights on serving audiences in the best way she knows how.

At first glance, seeing Henderson’s name attached to a TV series about vampires may seem like another random move. For the past several months, she has been knee deep in pre-production notes for the upcoming Netflix series “First Kill,” a drama about a teenage vampire who is ready to take her first life when she falls for a slayer whose family, obviously, is against their relationship. So once again, family dynamics are central to the story.

“With ‘First Kill,’ it happens to be vampire-versus-vampire slayer. It happens to be a white family and a Black family,” Henderson said. “It also happens to be these two young queer girls, and I think about my own queer goddaughter and nieces. They deserve to be represented on television. It’s very personal for me.”

Henderson started out in corporate finance. Eventually it was clear she’d need to get her MBA to move up the ranks of management, but she didn’t have money for business school. So she applied to a Peabody Foundation/NBC fellowship for people who were interested in television management to attend the University of Georgia. She had no intentions of being stuck in TV, but she got to travel to New York and Burbank where shows were made, and eventually realized she actually enjoyed the behind-the-scenes TV work. After graduating, she went into NBC’s management training program, where she was exposed to writing and reading scripts. One of her bosses told her to apply for the Warner Bros. Writers Workshop; there, she got the comedic chops to write jokes for Urkel.

These events all seemed to align perfectly for what was ahead, even if Henderson didn’t realize it at the time.

“When I was starting out, I wasn’t seeking to define myself. I was just seeking to get in where I fit in. When I started out, I just wanted to be in the game. I just wanted to be in the room where it happened,” she said. “I’ve always had a strong work ethic that I get from my dad. You show up and you show out. Working hard is how you show that you’re grateful that you got a job. And that’s all you have to do. It really is how I see anything that I’m doing.”

“Creative curiosity has always led me more than ‘here’s where I want to be in the business in five years,’” she said.

“Working hard is how you show that you’re grateful that you got a job. And that’s all you have to do. It really is how I see anything that I’m doing.”

In the ’90s, networks were booming with Black-led sitcoms, from “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” and “Moesha” to “Sister, Sister.” Henderson cut her teeth in the writers rooms and met some emerging Black creators like Mara Brock Akil, Vida Spears and Sara Finney-Johnson.

She says there’s nothing like being in a writers’ room with a goal to make everybody laugh. But for a curious creator like Henderson, going on to the next big gig looked quite differently at the turn of the century.

“I do believe in recreating yourself. If you’re unhappy where you are, recreate yourself. And so to that end, I’d written 8 o’clock family comedy for a few years and I loved it,” she said. “But I did that for a few years and I was like, ‘But what else is out there?’ Again, it’s just the way my brain works and how I move through the world.”

She went back to school again, this time to learn the technical skills needed to write dramas. She wrote her first screenplay at UCLA: “Samsonite Blue,” a semi-autobiographical drama about her relationship with her younger brother and their places in their larger family.

At the same time, Showtime began developing “Soul Food” into a TV series.

In yet another serendipitous moment, or perhaps it was ordained, one of the judges at the UCLA competition was the head of drama development at Paramount and fell in love with “Samsonite Blue.” Henderson met with Jerry Offsay, who was president of Showtime at the time, George Tillman, the director of the “Soul Food” film, and Tracey Edmonds, who was producing the series.

She sealed the deal with the answer to one interview question: “Why should I hire a comedy writer to adapt ‘Soul Food’?”

“Well, I’m one of six girls, so I will never run out of material,” Henderson responded.

Of course, she got the job. She became one of the first Black women to run a drama series, paving the way for Shonda Rhimes, Courtney A. Kemp and other Black female creators. With the show, Henderson also helped launch the careers of several actors, including Nicole Ari Parker and Boris Kodjoe, as well as of writer-producers Salim Akil and Kenya Barris. She also hired several Black women to direct over the course of the series.

“Soul Food” explored everything from complicated family dynamics to politics, from racial discrimination to mental disorders. Teri Joseph, portrayed by Parker, was a corporate attorney who dealt with a severe anxiety disorder. Henderson was able to pull from her sisters’ experiences with anxiety to tell that story in a way that had never been seen on television before. Today, more people are beginning to talk more openly about dealing with mental illnesses, but in the early 2000s, those portrayals on television were particularly revelatory.

“All I felt is like, ’I really hope that helps just one woman, one person,” Henderson said. “I hope one person saw themselves in that we see them too.”

It was this sincerity and desire to reach audiences in a new way that further convinced Edmonds that Henderson was the right choice to lead the series.

“As a showrunner, she was never afraid to dive into unchartered waters with storylines, tackle controversial subject matters, and explore Black love and sexuality with an authenticity that we had never seen before in a series,” Edmonds, who was a producer on both the “Soul Food” film and TV series, told HuffPost in an email. “She also came from the world of comedy, so I knew that she would bring warmth, flavor and levity to the writing that would set us apart from traditional dramas.”

Running a TV series like “Soul Food” did come with an intense amount of pressure. The network had high expectations for good ratings, and there was the added complication of depicting a Black family in a TV drama in a way no one had been able to successfully do so far. Henderson didn’t want to be weighed down by the idea that she couldn’t be free to show a multidimensional look at Black families and relationships. Those dynamics would be complicated; the characters would not all be perfect just because Black audiences didn’t get to see themselves on television enough. (Henderson admits that she’s glad social media wasn’t around at the time, because she’s sure there were storylines where “Black Twitter would have had my neck.”)

“I thought part of that secret sauce was going to be to not be precious about what we depicted,” she said. “I said, ‘My plan is to show us our three dimensionalities, to show us warts and all, to show us as complete people. That’s what my goal is.’ And that’s what I try to do.”

“I think the success of those shows about Black families — the ‘Empires’ and the ‘Powers’ and the ‘Queen Sugars’ of the world that are all about Black family — in some ways, I hope that part of what ‘Soul Food’ did was to lay the groundwork for the acceptance and treatment as normal the idea of Black families on television,” Henderson said.

“I think the success of those shows about Black families — the Empires and the Powers and the Queen Sugars of the world that are all about Black family — in some ways.”

Henderson shopped around a few other TV dramas once “Soul Food” ended in 2004, but she could not get them sold. She says networks treated the success of “Soul Food” as an anomaly. So over the next few years she turned to some of her other interests, and was a producer on several TV series including “Gossip Girl,” “Everybody Hates Chris” and “Fringe.”

Then in 2017, BET premiered “The Quad,” created by Henderson and Charles D. Holland. The series was an exploration of a woman in a man’s world, specifically how Dr. Eva Fletcher (Anika Noni Rose) would find her footing as the new president of a historically Black college. Of course, family dynamics were at play in this series, too, as Fletcher’s daughter Sydney (Jazz Raycole) attended the school. Raycole’s character was raped by a football player at school, and the series explores conversations about consent and rape culture on college campuses. These story arcs, when shown on television, rarely feature Black women.

At first, Henderson said, BET was resistant to the more serious storylines around rape culture, hoping for a more celebratory look at the HBCU experience. But she knew how important it was to tell these stories. Raycole, who said two of her close friends had been sexually assaulted, said it “was really important that the story be told not only with a certain amount of sensitivity but also with the ugly truth of the lingering pain that stays with the victim.”

Raycole said Henderson was very clear and open about how she wanted to tell the story and hopefully spark a conversation about consent.

“The moments I remember most were watching her be this extraordinary leader in every room, from the writer’s room to the set,” Raycole told HuffPost in an email. “Seeing a strong, smart, capable, Black woman write, produce, and run a show was something I will hold on to forever and something that inspired me to pursue filmmaking. There are very few female showrunners nonetheless Black female showrunners and Felicia is not only extraordinary at what she does but extremely aware and incredibly kind as she does it. What I learned from watching her was invaluable.”

The series only lasted two years, but Henderson said she’s hopeful that there will be more TV shows that focus on the HBCU experience. With Vice President Kamala Harris in the White House — and after an outpouring of support from HBCUs and Greek letter fraternities and sororities — Henderson predicted in January that there’d be an influx of shows centering these experiences. (We’re already seeing a glimmer that she was right: In February, The CW greenlit a pilot for an “All-American” spinoff series set at an HBCU.)

Like many people, Henderson began thinking intentionally about her next moves when COVID-19 brought everything to a halt in her industry. The killing of George Floyd also had a huge impact on her, as did the deaths of two of her friends.

“For the first time in my career, and yes, I waited for my 50s to say, ‘What do I want my career to look like?’ Because I’d always been driven by my creative and intellectual curiosity. I have very specific goals now,” she said. “I am empowered by where my heart sits as a Black person who sees the world recognizing the depth of institutional racism. I’m also just not willing to do anything anymore. Not that I’ve done a lot of it, but that in any way doesn’t uplift me or my people and I’m not going to be apologetic about what my goals are and where I want to go.”

When she’s not behind the camera, she is outspoken about the importance of political activism and focuses on her charity work. In June, she and the cast of “Soul Food” held a fundraiser for Sybrina Fulton, the mother of slain teen Trayvon Martin who was running for Miami-Dade County commissioner. She also works with the Jenesse Center, a domestic abuse facility in Los Angeles. On top of that, she just finished teaching a drama-writing class at Columbia University.

Along with TV producers Brock Akil, Finney-Johnson and filmmaker Gina Prince-Bythewood, she endowed the Four Sisters Scholarship at UCLA for students interested in telling the Black experience on screen. Her sisterhood with these women has lasted for years and is rooted in cheering each other on in the industry. In an interview with HuffPost’s Taryn Finley, Brock Akil said that support system has been vital to her work and it has shown up in many ways since they met on the set of “Moesha.”

“It looks like tears. It looks like holding each other’s hand. It looks like fussing at each other. It looks like giving each other time to figure some things out. It looks like sisterhood,” Brock Akil said. “And we hold a lot of each other’s not only memories and dreams, but we remind each other of each other’s beauty, and not just physical beauty but really the generosity of our hearts for each other.”

“Felicia reminded me to go get the things that I want, not always taking care of everybody else first before we take care of ourselves. So that’s another way our friendship looks.”

That camaraderie has kept her going — and Henderson still has a lot to give audiences. The premiere date for “First Kill” hasn’t yet been announced, but she is already working on “45 Days” for Amazon Studios. The limited series follows 15 different families during the civil rights era, and puts focus on the children at the center of the movement. One day, she hopes to direct movies and adapt a comic book series — and she always, always will focus on projects that elevate Black people and women. Along the way, she hopes to open up more opportunities for others to walk through the same doors she went through more than two decades ago.","['felicia', 'television', 'soul', 'tv', 'series', 'family', 'dramas', 'drama', 'staying', 'black', 'proved', 'food', 'henderson', 'd', 'way', 'power']",2021-02-26 22:17:21+00:00

Brooklyn “Hot Boy” rapper Bobby Shmurda was released from prison; Lauryn Hill made history as the first female rapper to reach diamond status in the U.S.; and Naomi Osaka won her fourth Grand Slam title at the Australian Open.

In this episode of “And THAT’s That,” drawing from the lens of Black history, the hosts imagine a future where all Black people have access to proper medicine and technological advancements, and imagine a moment in time where Black trans women are protected, loved and respected by all members of the community.

According to the Human Rights Campaign, at least 27 transgender and gender non-conforming people were violently killed in 2020 — more than any other year since HRC began tracking this data in 2013. Asanni Armon, a transgender activist and founder of the organization For the Gworls sat down with Shaquille Romblay to explain why we have to continue to emphasize that “Black Trans Lives Matter.”

“It is not a myth that the majority of Black trans people that are murdered across the spectrum, the vast majority of them are harmed by Black cis people,” Armon told HuffPost. “I think that we cannot have a very honest conversation about Black lives mattering if we cannot talk about the ways that Black cis people harm Black trans people. It is not about talking about Black on Black crime, but it is talking about the ways that cis people do hold power over Black trans people. If Black lives are supposed to matter, then that means all Black lives. I think that oftentimes people who support BLM don’t want to admit that a huge portion of the people on the front lines of BLM are Black queer people and trans people.”

42,['Religion Reporter'],"A Georgia pastor who has been expelled from America’s largest Protestant denomination for welcoming a queer couple into his congregation insists he doesn’t regret the decision he made.

Pastor Jim Conrad, of Kennesaw’s Towne View Baptist Church, got in trouble with the Southern Baptist Convention after welcoming a gay couple with three adopted children as members of his church in October 2019.

“We decided that ‘all means all,’” Conrad told HuffPost in an email. “We will share His Good News with everyone and welcome anyone who calls Jesus Lord.”

About 30% of the congregation left after Conrad took this stance, which meant the church’s budget shrunk and the pastor took a pay cut, according to The Associated Press. And on Tuesday, the SBC’s executive committee announced that it was kicking Towne View Baptist out of its network of churches for “affirming homosexuality.”

“We are guilty as charged,” the pastor said.

Conrad, a longtime Southern Baptist, said he felt some personal grief over being expelled from a denomination that has been part of his spiritual life for decades. But the SBC has moved farther to the right in recent years than the pastor is comfortable with, he said.

Conrad also pointed out that conservative theology on sexual orientation and gender is “at least complicit” in the “alarmingly” high rate of suicide attempts among LGBTQ adolescents.

“Telling teens that the God who created them in his image hates them because they aren’t straight or cisgender is a dangerous message,” he said.

Conrad said his church doesn’t plan to appeal the executive committee’s decision. Asked if he would make the same decision again, knowing the outcome, Conrad wrote, “YES!”

“If the grace of God isn’t for everybody then it’s not for anybody,” Conrad wrote.

If the grace of God isn’t for everybody then it’s not for anybody. Pastor Jim Conrad

The SBC’s executive committee announced the expulsion at the close of the denomination’s annual conference in Nashville, Tennessee. In addition to Towne View Baptist, the committee disfellowshipped a second church for apparently affirming homosexuality ― Kentucky’s St. Matthews Baptist Church. The church reportedly made financial contributions to another Baptist network, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, which lets member churches hire LGBTQ individuals in non-ministerial roles.

Two additional churches were also disfellowshipped at the meeting, both for employing pastors convicted of sex offenses ― Tennessee’s Antioch Baptist Church and Pennsylvania’s West Side Baptist Church. The SBC has faced calls in recent years for greater accountability on the issue of sexual abuse.

The SBC, which was founded in 1845 in defense of slavery, views itself as a network of over 50,000 independent and self-governing Baptist churches. This doctrine of autonomy has sometimes prevented the group from acting in a unified way on certain issues, such as creating a denomination-wide database of sex offenders. But this doesn’t mean joint action is rare ― the SBC has reportedly disfellowshipped at least six churches in little over a decade for affirming or endorsing queer relationships.

The expulsions come at a time when Black members of the SBC are questioning whether the denomination will also hold churches accountable for failing to understand how racism still affects Black Americans.

Earlier this year, two Southern Baptist pastors from Texas publicly compared Vice President Kamala Harris to the Bible’s Queen Jezebel ― drawing on a trope that Black religious scholars say is both racist and sexist. One of those pastors, Steve Swofford, sits on the SBC’s executive committee and was the chair of the team responsible for selecting the committee’s president. He has yet to face discipline for his words. The SBC executive committee chairman was not available for comment, a spokesperson said.

Some Black pastors have left or have contemplated leaving the denomination over leaders’ unwillingness to grapple with how systemic racism persists in America. One of those pastors is Dwight McKissic, a conservative Black pastor from Texas whose ties to the SBC have been fraying in recent weeks.

McKissic suggested on Twitter that, while he agrees with the SBC’s decision to boot out churches over their approach to LGBTQ people, he thinks churches should also be disfellowshipped for not disciplining their members for “racism & rebellion.”

It feels great to find a point of agreement with Dr. Mohler. I hope he’d agree with me that churches who harbor members who participated in the insurrection & paraded Confederate Flags, ought also be disfellowshipped for not discipling their members for racism & rebellion. https://t.co/dnKG8WoW7t — Dwight McKissic (@pastordmack) February 23, 2021","['welcoming', 'churches', 'executive', 'guilty', 'evangelical', 'pastors', 'church', 'lgtbq', 'charged', 'defends', 'sbc', 'disfellowshipped', 'conrad', 'proudly', 'baptist', 'pastor', 'members']",2021-02-24 17:06:59-05:00
43,[],"Police officers shown on body camera video holding Daniel Prude down naked and handcuffed on a city street last winter until he stopped breathing will not face criminal charges, according to a grand jury decision announced Tuesday.

The 41-year-old Black man’s death last March sparked nightly protests in Rochester, New York, after the video was released nearly six months later, with demonstrators demanding a reckoning for police and city officials.

State Attorney General Letitia James, whose office took over the prosecution and impaneled a grand jury, said “the criminal justice system is badly in need of reform.”

“While I know that the Prude family, the Rochester community, and communities across the country will rightfully be devastated and disappointed, we have to respect this decision,” James said in a prepared release. “Serious reform is needed, not only at the Rochester Police Department, but to our criminal justice system as a whole.”

Lawyers for the seven police officers suspended over Prude’s death have said the officers were strictly following their training that night, employing a restraining technique known as “segmenting.” They claimed Prude’s use of PCP, which caused irrational behavior, was “the root cause” of his death.

The video made public on Sept. 4 shows Prude handcuffed and naked with a spit hood over his head as an officer pushes his face against the ground, while another officer presses a knee to his back. The officers held him down for about two minutes until he stopped breathing. He was taken off life support a week later.

The county medical examiner listed the manner of death as homicide caused by “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint” and cited PCP as a contributing factor.

Prude’s family filed a federal lawsuit alleging the police department sought to cover up the true nature of his death.

Officers Troy Taladay, Paul Ricotta, Francisco Santiago, Andrew Specksgoor, Josiah Harris and Mark Vaughn, along with Sgt. Michael Magri, were suspended after Prude’s death became public.

Democratic Mayor Lovely Warren fired police chief La’Ron Singletary shortly after the video’s release, while rejecting calls from demonstrators that she resign. Singletary has said in legal papers that Warren told him to lie to support her assertion that she hadn’t learned of Prude’s death until months later, and fired him for his refusal to do so. A city spokesperson said his version of events confirms Warren never saw the video until August.

The city halted its investigation into Prude’s death when James’ office began its own investigation in April. Under New York law, deaths of unarmed people in police custody are typically turned over to the attorney general’s office, rather than handled by local officials.","['involved', 'rochester', 'city', 'office', 'charges', 'james', 'officers', 'death', 'daniel', 'prudes', 'warren', 'prude', 'video']",2021-02-23 16:48:25-05:00

Spread awareness on social media.

Since these racially motivated attacks began, many Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) advocates have decried the lack of media coverage and the seeming indifference of many Americans to these attacks.

Now that you’re aware of what’s going on, share what you know with friends and family on social media. Speak out and stand in solidarity with the Asian community.

“People are hurting and want to feel like their voices are being heard,” said Zeena Koda, the co-founder of Asian American Collective. “Use the power of the internet to bring awareness to our larger community and educate each other.”

Not sure what to say? That’s OK. Pass the mic by retweeting and sharing the words and work of Asian American activists who are speaking out and trying to disseminate information about how to help.

45,['Story D. Watkins'],"Before 2001, I’d flirted with the drug game. I knew the dealers, corner stragglers, nickel shavers and block bosses all the way to the dudes who were juggling enough weight to sedate small towns. These were all people who hung in and around the neighborhood, my house even. I tried my hand, made a few transactions, but wasn’t committed because I never wanted to cop out to being just another dope dealer. It wasn’t a moral thing, really, I just looked in the mirror and saw a computer engineer or a lawyer staring back, not a criminal. But by the end of 2001, like many people in my age group and from my block, I sat stiff at the end of an IKEA two-chair kitchen table set, putting packages of $3, $6, $10, $20 and $50 blast together.

My best friend—who I’ll call Nick to protect his family and children—worked with me, but he couldn’t get the crack in the vial as quick as I could because his fingers were too fat, he talked too much and dude had a serious problem focusing. Really, nobody around me during that particular time could cap as fast. I was in a rush to get to the money, but patient enough to follow the necessary steps.

“We the next millionaires comin’ out of Baldamore, Dee!” Nick would yell, flopping his truck-wide frame all over the room, bouncing off of the damaged drywall, constantly knocking dishes off table edges with his huge ass. “Look at all dis work!”

We had some quick success down on Curley Street with a product we branded as “Yeah Buddy.” The cash poured in with steady traffic on a block that no one really paid attention to. Our little drug shop ran from about 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. Peace is held when you split up times—some other guys hustled during the same shift as us, but they were heroin dealers. We sold crack, so our clientele was completely different. The only other crack guys came out around 10 p.m., older dudes who had day jobs or something. Everything was smooth until I found out some of them were calling their crack Yeah Buddy, pretending to be us.

“It’s mainly Clarence,” Nick said, looking at his reflection in a chrome pistol. “We handle him, the problem over.”

I honestly didn’t care if Clarence and the rest of those dudes made a couple of dollars off of the Yeah Buddy name. But the streets don’t work like that—if one person ripped you off on Monday, you’d wake up to a million lined up to get you on Tuesday. It’s probably the same way the cops feel when they patrol together and run up on dudes like us.

I tucked my pistol in my dip and hopped shotgun in Nick’s car. A wooden bat rested in the back seat, not an official baseball bat, but the mini-slugger they give you as a gift for attending Orioles home games. We drove down to Curley, just in time to see Clarence closing down his shop.

“Yo, Clarence!” I said. “You still selling Yeah Buddy?”

“Fresh out, youngin’,” he replied. “What the fuck y’all want?”

I was going to tell him that he couldn’t sell it no more, and I was going to follow with a threat and some shit talk and maybe a joke because I wasn’t really trying to beef with him. But then Nick swung the bat, cracking Clarence in the side of his head.

I stopped the third blow and kneeled down next to Clarence.

“We not asking you no more,” I said.

Clarence got up holding his head. Nick cracked him again—and this time the bat broke.

The whole Clarence situation was a boost to our reputations. Everyone ran around telling the story of how Nick and I cracked Clarence’s head in half like a sunflower seed over some money. But that rep also had a downside. Working people in that neighborhood had known that Nick and I dibbled and dabbled, but we weren’t looked at as violent drug dealers until that incident. We had traded the love we earned from being goofy, fun kids for the same type of fear cops like Hersl used on the streets.

Like those police, we now had zero allies, and that’s why Curley Street dried up—people started calling the cops, little fights started breaking out and the whole thing just became a mess. Nick and I built a small crew and set up shop a few minutes away on Madeira Street. There were no drug crews when we built the spot, but we still ended up catching static from this kid named Dress-Code.

I didn’t flinch as he squeezed the trigger, but shut my eyes as the hammer clicked.

We caught Dress-Code one night after taking the women we were dating to an R&B concert in D.C. He was on the corner sharing jokes with his crew, a little drunk. I told my date to pull the car over, reached in the glove box and pulled out my pistol.

“Dress, what’s up, man?” I said, getting out.

He said he was looking for me, before landing a hard right across my jawline, hard enough for me to feel my teeth rattle. It dazed me and I gathered myself, squaring up and dipping my chin. Nick got out of the car and sparked a blunt. Dress-Code charged at me, I grabbed his shoulders and used the momentum to sling him to the ground—his fist or elbow hit my lip again, it burst, I felt blood and spit welling up in my mouth.

We're not kidding.

After a pretty even fight, I got the upper hand. I pulled the gun out and slapped Dress across the face with it. He hit the ground, barely catching himself. I stood over him, placing both of my knees on his arm, and used the butt of the gun to beat some teeth out of his mouth. I beat him until his blood covered my shirt, until our blood mixed, until he was unconscious, until Nick pulled me off of him like, “Chill, D Watk, you gonna kill him!”

Looking back, it was probably in that moment that I was closest to Hersl. We were both defining our territory—drawing our lines in blood and being rewarded for it. Nick and I locked down Madeira Street for a while; however, our time there didn’t last long because of another cop, who worked with Hersl. “I know exactly who you are, Lil Dwight!” he said once, after slamming me against a wall and then his car.

“I don’t know you, man—wrong guy,” I said, turning my face away. He dug in my pocket, pulled out a couple of dollars, kept them, kicked me up my ass and told me to be on my way.

“Nick, we gotta get off this block, it’s too hot,” I warned.

“You worry too much, D. We good.”

We weren’t. By 2004, Hersl was 34 years old and had been moved into working with some plainclothes units. The plainclothes cops, who are also called knockers and jump-out boys, were all about “proactive policing” and stats—how many people you can throw in jail. The Maryland Judiciary Case Search shows that Hersl alone made hundreds of arrests in 2002. The next year, BPD made more than 100,000 arrests—that’s roughly one-sixth of the population and a staggering 274 arrests a day.

A beat cop in East Baltimore.

They were patting everybody down, even the women, pocketing what they found and throwing the n-word around like it was our official title. I never carried large amounts of cash—doing so was like begging to be robbed by cops or stick-up kids—but Hersl and cops like him definitely got a few come-ups of $100 to $400 off me.

Hersl and a partner once clipped me for a few dollars at a bar called High Hats, probably one of the few lounges in America where customers actually have to bring their drink of choice to the establishment. We young dudes drank Belvedere, Rémy and Hennessey, but High Hats only had Ripple, Old Grand-Dad 100 and other brands that the elderly enjoyed. So we grabbed the bottles from cut-rates and left them at the bar with our names attached.

Some of us young hustlers would chill there before going to work our blocks, and others would wind down with a sip after our shift. I was pregaming for a date when Hersl and another cop came in the bar, shouting the routine even though we already knew it, making all of us exit through the side door. Against the side of the building, we assumed the position: facing the wall with our hands pressed against it, legs spread and, of course, our pockets open. Hersl and his buddy patted all of our pockets, tipping themselves with whatever they found. I didn’t have a lot of cash on me, $200 or $300 at most. I was upset, but not too upset because I sold drugs and paying cops like Hersl was just a tax. In those years, the cops were so fucked up, and they rolled us so much, that I didn't think that much about being robbed by a person who gets paid to protect people. A normal person would be scared, terrorized even, but because this was all part of the game we were playing, it hardly left an impression on me. Now it’s hard to separate it from all the other times I’d been held up. When the cops finished being crooks, we went back inside and finished drinking.

But I remember another time, when Hersl caught me at CC’s carryout with a small amount of weed. I was walking out of the store with my chicken box and a half-and-half, just in time for Hersl to line me up against the wall with the rest of the people hanging out in front of the store. He took my grass and my cash and let me go, which was cool because those dudes were locking people up for anything.

Everything I had going against me he had going for him. Us young Black dudes who were slanging were hated, hunted and haunted for our role in the drug war. He was praised and honored and rewarded with overtime. Eventually I got tired of dealing, jaded even, and after a few of my friends were arrested and or murdered, I quit. Nick begged me to return, but I was done.

Our neighborhood and our industry were crumbling under the weight of the drug war, and so was Nick. He had a serious pill problem, popping Oxys like Tic Tacs. Everyone knew the pills were eating at him, but it still hurt when he developed a heroin addiction. Then he pulled a gun on me.

I didn’t flinch as he squeezed the trigger, but shut my eyes as the hammer clicked. It clicked. He said, “Bow!” I opened my eyes, and it clicked again. He looked down the same barrel, said, “Well, damn,” put it in his dip and bumped my shoulder as he walked past me. The gun was empty. At this stage of his addiction, his swollen-bloated caramel cheeks that used to wobble when he laughed at his own jokes had completely evaporated until you could see the shape of his jaw bone. I probably could’ve taken the gun and beat welts onto his head, but I let him go. I started staying away from the block he was stuck to. In 2006, he was gunned down by some dudes he was robbing with and eventually stole from.

In 2007, I enrolled in the University of Baltimore—a college in the middle of the city that was known for catering to older students and helping its graduates find jobs, exactly what I needed. I was a street guy and didn’t really know what to major in. I guess my background was business, but classes on that seemed boring. So I took the basics and decided to figure it out. I spent the rest of my time wandering around the city looking for a job. I had no real connections or traditional work experience—just a bunch of time and the will to submit 20-plus applications a week. Now that I was out of the game, I wasn’t even really talking to my friends who were still dealing. I forgot about Hersl. But he didn’t quit.","['pulled', 'really', 'nick', 'street', 'hersl', 'cops', 'dudes', 'clarence', 'didnt', 'hated', 'drug', 'cop', 'baltimores']",
46,[],"3 Defining Deviance Downward

ENRON USED TO BE CONSIDERED the capstone to the Golden Age of white-collar prosecutions, a shining example of the system working like it’s supposed to. Weeks after the company filed America's then-largest corporate bankruptcy, federal agents searched its headquarters and discovered a $63 billion game of three-card monte. Using an intricate network of off-the-books shell companies, Enron executives made loans look like income and debt look irrelevant. The year before the company collapsed, its leaders had falsified 96 percent of its net income and 105 percent of its cash flow.

Between 2002 and 2006, the FBI’s Enron Task Force filed charges against more than 30 architects of Enron's fraud. Investigators discovered a “shred room” at the company’s financial auditor, Arthur Andersen, and convicted the company of obstruction of justice. Four Merrill Lynch bankers were found guilty of helping Enron falsify its financial returns by purchasing three Nigerian barges. Task force agents convinced the company’s chief financial officer to testify against his higher-ups by threatening to charge his wife with a felony. He flipped; they convicted her of a misdemeanor.

Eventually, after a five-year investigation, Enron founder Ken Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted of securities fraud and a meal deal of lesser charges. Though Lay died at a rented mansion in Colorado shortly afterwards, Skilling got 24 years in prison. At the time, it was one of the longest white-collar sentences in U.S. history. Prosecutors called it a victory. Skilling’s lawyers called it just the beginning.

As soon as the nation turned its attention elsewhere, Skilling’s lawyers began quietly dismantling his sentence. They filed appeals objecting to the statutes used to convict him, the trial’s Houston location and the questionnaires filled out by potential jurors. In 2013, citing the “extraordinary resources” it had spent prosecuting and defending Skilling’s conviction, the Department of Justice agreed to cut ten years off Skilling’s sentence if he promised not to file any more appeals. He was released in February 2019 after serving less than half his original sentence.

The rest of the FBI’s victory has crumbled under the same blitzkrieg of high-priced lawyering. The Supreme Court overturned Arthur Andersen’s conviction in 2005. The convictions of three of the Merrill Lynch bankers were vacated after they convinced an appeals court that they were merely trying to “solidify business relationships” rather than acting for personal gain. In the end, just 18 people served prison sentences (by comparison, more than 500 served time for the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s). Fourteen of them served fewer than four years. Andrew Fastow, the mastermind of Enron’s network of shell companies, now makes his living lecturing business school students and fraud investigators about how he did it.

Nearly every high-profile corporate scandal has the same overlooked epilogue. The wealthy have always attempted to spend their way to lighter sentences, but in the last two decades, the American judicial system has become increasingly willing to let them.

Fraud by large corporations costs Americans up to $360 billion per year—the equivalent of two decades’ worth of street crime. SOURCE: NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE.

“We’ve seen a concerted effort to define deviance downward,” said Paul Leighton, a professor at Eastern Michigan University and the co-author of “The Rich Get Richer and the Poor Get Prison.” “We’ve made felonies into misdemeanors, misdemeanors into torts and torts into regulatory offenses.”

Honest services fraud, for example, is the subsection of mail and wire fraud that prohibits companies from lying to customers to get their business and CEOs from lying to investors after they’ve already been hired. Think of a mechanic telling you that your perfectly functional transmission is busted, then telling you it will cost $2,000 to fix it. He hasn’t defrauded you exactly—he really will replace your transmission—but he used his position of authority to scam you into paying for something you didn’t need.

Since 1909, prosecutors have used the honest services fraud provision to go after companies that lie to boost their stock price and politicians who give golfing buddies lucrative procurement contracts. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff, a former white collar prosecutor, once referred to the statute as “our Colt 45, our Louisville Slugger, our Cuisinart.”

But over the last three decades, the Supreme Court has taken the law apart piece by piece. In 1987, the Rehnquist Court ruled that the statute should never have been used to protect the so-called “right to honest services.” In 2010, the court restricted its application to public-sector bribery and kickbacks. From now on, the lying mechanic is breaking the law only if someone else is paying him to scam you.

Based on that ruling, several white collar criminals—including, wait for it, Jeffrey Skilling—had their sentences or convictions vacated. This year, two former Chris Christie underlings will tell the Supreme Court that orchestrating the ""Bridgegate"" conspiracy, in which they deliberately orchestrated traffic jams to get revenge on a Democratic mayor, is no longer illegal under the new, narrowed definition. If the Supreme Court agrees, the law will get even weaker.

There will never be a wake-up call for corporations; the justice system doesn’t do that anymore.

Other white collar statutes have suffered the same slow strangulation. In 2006, a district court judge reaffirmed the right of companies to pay the legal fees of their executives, effectively giving every C-suite defendant the same deep pockets as their corporate employer. Since 1996, the Supreme Court has consistently blocked plaintiffs from receiving punitive damages, arguing that large punishments deprive corporations of their due process rights. In 2016, the court ruled that federal bribery law only applies to politicians who traded official acts for personal benefit—the kind of immediate, explicit kickback that rarely happens outside of corporate HR training videos.

“Criminal law used to be more closely aligned to our moral intuitions,” said Will Thomas, a University of Michigan professor who studies corporate liability. “We still talk about it like it’s a guiding moral force, but it’s a much more administrative process now.”

Today, Thomas explained, judges are more willing to disregard the consequences of their rulings (like, say, an Enron-scale fraud going unpunished) in favor of resolving obscure procedural ambiguities. In 2017, for instance, a case against New York financier Benjamin Wey was dismissed after he successfully argued that the search warrant used to gather evidence against him was overly broad and vaguely worded.

The confounding thing about these challenges is that they often highlight real weaknesses in the criminal justice system. American law is a contradictory jungle of century-old statutes and arbitrary definitions. Lying to government investigators, for example, is prohibited by at least 215 separate laws, each with their own standard of proof. Mens rea, the concept of “guilty mind” central to establishing criminal liability, has more than 100 definitions across various statutes.

So of course wealthy defendants win cases by arguing that fraud statutes and insider trading rules are poorly written. They are. But so are the rest of the laws. (Numerous state anti-gang statutes, for example, define ""gang"" so imprecisely that they could apply to most sororities.) The only difference is that white-collar defendants have the ability to dispute every step of the process used to convict them—and a judicial system all too happy to oblige.

One of the most conspicuous aspects of white-collar cases is the doting, near-veterinary care with which judges try to prevent defendants from facing harsh punishment. In 2014, a Colorado judge ruled that two farm owners whose tainted cantaloupes caused a listeria outbreak and killed 33 people couldn't be sent to prison because it would interfere with their ability to earn income for their families. As he announced a sentence of five years probation, the judge explained, “I must deliver both justice and mercy.”

More than 50% of auditors for the country’s largest companies said they had been asked to falsify internal audit reports. SOURCE: INSTITUTE OF INTERNAL AUDITORS.

According to a study by the Federal Judicial Center, four out of five judges in federal courts (where the vast majority of white-collar cases are decided) are white. A 2010 survey found that they have an average age of nearly 70. Their base salary is $210,000 per year.

It is, as one of those high-priced lawyers might say, improbable that these demographic and economic facts exert no influence whatsoever on judges' rulings. In a 2012 review of sentencing data in Florida, researchers found that “high-status” white collar criminals, such as doctors scamming Medicaid, were 98.7 percent less likely to receive prison terms than welfare fraudsters. A 2015 study found that judges showed increasing mercy as fraud offenders moved up the income scale: Criminals who stole more than $400 million got sentences that were less than half of the minimum recommended by federal guidelines. Criminals who stole $5,000 or less served sentences well over the minimum.

“When you zoom out, you see all the ways that bias accumulates throughout the system,” said Justin Levinson, a University of Hawaii professor and the editor of “Implicit Racial Bias Across The Law.” Sentencing guidelines prescribe lighter punishments for first-time offenders and criminals who can afford to pay restitution. Evidence rules make it nearly impossible to seize records or computers from corporations. Jury selection weeds out the poor, the less educated and minorities.

And then there’s the matter of criminal liability. For many low-level crimes, prosecutors have to prove that a defendant should have known a crime was taking place. If a renter deals drugs out of her apartment, her landlord can be prosecuted. If you loan your friend your car and he commits a murder while driving it, you can be charged with murder, too. For executive-level crimes, however, the bar of criminal liability is set impossibly high: Prosecutors have to prove that defendants knew their actions were illegal and did them anyway. This myopic focus on intent means that white-collar trials often come down to the question of whether the defendant was the kind of person who would commit a criminal act.

John Lauro, an attorney who has represented healthcare and financial executives, said he always emphasizes the complexity of white-collar crimes to the jury—financial disclosures are so technical! How could my client possibly know that stock wasn’t going to pan out? He also plays up the upstanding-citizen angle. The first thing he does when he lands a new client, he said, is visit their homes and meet their families.

“I bring in things like their marriage, their kids and whether they coach little league,” he said. “The prosecution always wants to dehumanize them. They call my client ‘the defendant.’ I’ll call him by his first name until a judge tells me to stop.”

The only way to get around this, said Sarah Larkin, a securities fraud prosecutor in Manhattan (she couldn’t speak on the record, so that’s not her real name), is to make every crime seem as simple as possible. It’s lying, it’s cheating, it’s stealing. She structures every trial like a crash course, spending days explaining how the stock market works and what acronyms like SEC, CDO and GAAP stand for. Before she can convince jurors that the defendant lied on a financial statement, she has to do a week-long “Big Short” interlude to teach them what a financial statement even is—without the help of Margot Robbie in a bathtub.

“And after all that,” she said, “you still have to make the case for why this person who looks very upper-middle-class and has a family sitting in the back row should be branded a criminal. It’s a heavy lift.”

The near-impossibility of establishing white-collar defendants’ motives combines with the high standard of reasonable doubt to create a paradox. Most Americans have a visceral aversion to greedy executives in general. Introduce them to a single banker and a specific crime, however, and their moral outrage often melts away. As Sam Buell, a Duke University law professor, told me: “Put people on a jury and they’ll say, ‘Gee, it seems like this guy was doing his job, so I don’t think it was a crime.’”

Take the case of Brian Stoker, a Citigroup employee who was charged in 2011 with marketing risky investments (one trader called them “dogsh!t” in an internal communication) as safe bets. According to the SEC, the bank made $160 million while investors lost $700 million. In his closing argument, Stoker’s attorney showed the jury an illustration from a “Where’s Waldo” book. Their client was a nobody, he suggested, a scapegoat for the culture of high-stakes gambling that had taken over the entire financial sector. Why make him a patsy when everyone else was doing the same thing?

The jury declared Stoker not guilty. But in the same envelope as their decision, they included a handwritten note. “This verdict,” it read, “should not deter the S.E.C. from continuing to investigate the financial industry.” In other words: Keep trying to lock up greedy bankers. Just not this one.

And this is it, the Rosetta Stone for understanding why judges are so comfortable explaining away the misconduct of corporate executives; why Congress never strengthened the castrated white-collar statutes; why so few pharmaceutical executives have been imprisoned for the opioid crisis and only a single banker went to prison for the financial crash. American law is incapable of prosecuting crimes in which elites use their legitimate power for nefarious ends.

“The way businesses harm people is the same way they interact with them normally,” Albertson said. Banks collect debts and foreclose on homes every day. Banks give out home loans every day. When they entice customers into unaffordable mortgages or foreclose on borrowers tricked into signing loans they can’t afford, the courts can’t tell the difference.

This insight also explains why the legal system applies the opposite logic to organizations run by the rich and organizations run by the poor. Teenage gang members who argue that they committed crimes due to the culture of the Crips or the Latin Kings receive harsher sentences—stealing money for yourself is bad; stealing money for a criminal organization is worse. Corporate defendants who claim they committed crimes due to the internal culture of Goldman Sachs or HSBC, on the other hand, get lighter sentences—how could an individual possibly be held accountable for something everyone else was doing?

And so, as they lose the ability to prosecute high-level crimes and elite offenders, many of America’s criminal justice institutions have simply stopped trying. Of the 649 companies prosecuted by the Department of Justice since 2015, only eight were convicted in court. The rest either took settlements or negotiated themselves a deferred prosecution or non-prosecution agreement.

These arrangements, like so many other aspects of America’s white-collar enforcement apparatus, represent the cynical perversion of a benign idea. Deferred prosecution agreements were created in the 1930s to allow first-time juvenile offenders to avoid jail time if they followed probation rules and didn’t reoffend. Since the early 1990s, prosecutors began extending the principle to corporations: If you agree to investigate your own crimes, turn over evidence against your employees and change your internal policies, we won’t take you to court.

Since then, deferred prosecutions have become one of the primary engines of American impunity. They don’t require companies to explicitly admit guilt and don’t apply steeper punishments to repeat offenders. While courts often appoint independent monitors to make sure corporations comply with the terms of their probation, these reports aren’t released to the public. Since 1999, only three companies have ever been prosecuted for violating the terms of their agreements.

“Criminal law isn’t just about deterrence, it’s about moral education,” said John Coffee, the director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia Law School. “You show the public that a crime occurred and how terrible its impact was. We’re missing that catharsis now.”","['age', 'used', 'white', 'golden', 'court', 'crimes', 'corporate', 'collar', 'criminal', 'law', 'financial', 'companies', 'crime', 'whitecollar', 'fraud']",

“ANATION OF IMMIGRANTS”—THESE FOUR WORDS, ( 2 ) The phrase was popularized by John F. Kennedy, who used it as the title of his 1958 book. genius in their concision, mask the messiest of histories. People like to recall that George Washington wanted America to “be an Asylum to the persecuted of the earth.” Less often praised: Ben Franklin’s contention that immigrants are “the most ignorant Stupid Sort of their own Nation.” Americans have been having some version of this argument ever since. And for much of the country’s existence, public opinion towards immigration has ranged from tepid to hostile. As Daniel Tichenor, author of the comprehensive history, “Dividing Lines,” puts it, “We love the immigrant past and dread the immigrant present.”

One rare exception came after the Civil War, when the country was desperate to replace the men who had died on the battlefield. A flourishing postwar confidence revived the idea that the country could absorb a never-ending stream of foreigners and fuse their best characteristics into that superior being, an American.

The turn began in the 1880s. Extremes of wealth had sparked massive labor strikes; out West, people fretted that the land was running out. Now, newcomers were a threat, and the more foreign they seemed, the more threatening they were. An early warning was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first-ever prohibition of all people of a specific race. Over the next decade, a surge of European migrants accounted for 40 percent of population growth. From the 1890s, this wave was dominated not by English, Scandanavians, Germans or Irish, but by poorer southern and eastern Europeans and Russian Jews. As the country slid into a long depression, the new immigrants became the source and the target of a tinderbox anxiety. There were lynchings of Italians in New Orleans; attacks on Jewish farmers by Mississippi nightriders; a riot against Russian Jewish factory workers in New Jersey.

For decades, nativists in Congress tried and failed to translate this hostility into new immigration laws. It wasn’t until the early 1920s, after Warren Harding was elected president on an “America First” platform, that two Republican lawmakers, Representative Albert Johnson and Senator David Reed, finally realized a restrictionist dream: a comprehensive racial quota system devised to keep American bloodlines pure. “[T]he country would never be the same,” wrote John Higham in his definitive account of American nativism, “Strangers in the Land”—“either in its social structure or in its habits of mind.”

To build the public case for their legislation, Johnson and Reed teamed up with the leading eugenicists of the day. Johnson enlisted Harry Laughlin, who in 1936 received an honorary degree from a German university for his contributions to the “science of racial cleansing,” to conduct research for the House Immigration Committee. Johnson also worked closely with Madison Grant, whose manifesto, “The Passing of the Great Race,” is a deranged codification of white men into three “races” of descending desirability—Nordics, Alpines and Mediterraneans. Grant’s conclusion, drawn from spurious analyses of skull shape and nose width, was that the new immigrants should be scientifically excluded from the definition of whiteness. They were “human flotsam … breeding out their masters and killing by filth and by crowding as effectively as by the sword.”

In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge signed the Johnson-Reed Act, which accorded with his own belief that that “America must be kept American.” The law would ultimately shut down most immigration except for a meager inflow dominated by people Madison Grant would have called Nordics. Everyone else faced waitlists of 10 to 75 years, depending on the quota allotted to their country of origin. The law also birthed a national immigration bureaucracy—what Tichenor calls “an increasingly elaborate immigration control system of racist design.”

Until this point, nearly everyone who arrived at a port of entry like Ellis Island was admitted to the United States. There was no requirement for a visa. Johnson-Reed was deliberately engineered to prevent most immigrants from ever boarding a steamship, by requiring them to obtain visas from U.S. consulates abroad. The State Department, which ran the consulates, was notoriously anti-Semitic: In 1921, the chief of the Consular Service supplied a report to Congress describing Jewish people as “filthy, un-American, and often dangerous in their habits.” By the 1930s, as Hitler launched his assault on the Jews of Europe, the new visa system was perfectly calibrated not to help the growing ranks of refugees, but to keep them out.

In 1934, President Franklin Roosevelt ordered consulates to give Jewish refugees “the most humane and favorable treatment possible under law.” After that, admissions actually went down. Mere presidential preference was no match for the immigration bureaucracy, which erected, in the words of historian David Wyman, a formidable “paper wall.”

The paper wall’s architect was Samuel Miller Breckinridge Long—Breckinridge Long to the public. Thin and rangy, intermittently beset by nervous ailments, Long was born to a family that was practically Confederate aristocracy. He’d glided through Princeton, married into money and spent a good deal of his career as a bureaucrat of middling talents. Thanks to his old pal “Frank” Roosevelt, in 1939 he was put in charge of refugee admissions, though he had no relevant experience. From then on, Roosevelt essentially abdicated refugee policy to Long because he was so spooked by the politics: In 1938, the year of Kristallnacht, 86 percent of Americans opposed an emergency increase of refugee admissions.

Breckinridge Long (Myron Davis/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty)

From the nativists' perspective, Long was the best possible man for the moment. He believed the overwhelming majority of refugees were propagandists, subversives, freeloaders and derelicts. And he knew exactly how to protect his country from the “alien influx”—with the merciless application of rules, regulations, procedures and forms.

In 1940, Long issued a memo instructing subordinates to avoid granting visas to European refugees for a “temporary period of indefinite length.” From today's vantage point, his methods are eerily familiar. “We could do this by simply advising our consuls to put every obstacle in the way and to require additional evidence and resort to various administrative devices which would postpone and postpone and postpone the granting of the visas,” he explained. Later, he would crow in his diary: “The cables practically stopping immigration went!”

Consular officials had enormous latitude in determining a refugee’s fate. In France, you had to obtain an exit visa, a transit visa, an entry visa for the U.S., moral and political affidavits of support, certificates of good behavior and a paid ticket for the ship. You couldn’t get a visa without a ticket, which were sold out months in advance, and you couldn’t get a ticket without a visa, which were only valid for four months, and if just one of your documents had expired on the day of departure, you had to start all over again.

“It takes months and months to grant the visas and then it usually applies to a corpse.”

One of the most powerful tools employed by visa officials was the public charge rule—a component of federal law which states that a person can’t be admitted to the United States if they are likely to become a burden on the state. Although the rule had been on the books since 1882, it was barely observed until the Depression. Under Long, consulates wielded it with abandon. To Jewish refugees of Nazi Germany, the rule must have seemed like a sadistic joke, since throughout the 1930s they had been forced to relinquish up to 90 percent of their capital when they left the country. Even if they were lucky enough to have American financial sponsors, the standards of proof were constantly shifting. As a result, there were multiple years after Hitler seized power in which the U.S. did not fill its annual quota of just under 30,000 immigrants from Germany. In 1938, for example, the State Department admitted 19,552 former residents of the Third Reich, not all of whom were Jewish.

And yet Breckinridge Long wasn’t satisfied. Convinced Germany was infiltrating America with spies disguised as refugees, he created, for the first time, a centralized immigration processing system based in Washington. Applicants submitted letters of support, financial records and character testimonies. Sponsors were scrutinized. Five committees from different agencies reviewed every application. After that, the flow of refugees nearly stopped altogether. In a speech, Representative Emanuel Cellar blamed Long for the “gruesome bottleneck.” He observed: “It takes months and months to grant the visas and then it usually applies to a corpse.”

In January 1944, Treasury Secretary Robert Morgenthau demanded a meeting with Roosevelt and Long to discuss the situation. He came armed with an investigative memo, which he titled “Report to the Secretary on the Acquiescence of This Government in the Murder of the Jews.” It documented Long’s machinations in devastating detail. Roosevelt immediately agreed to create a War Refugee Board outside Long’s control. Its work during the remainder of the war demonstrated just how many more lives could have been saved: According to Wyman, it managed to rescued around 200,000 people in 18 months.

Long fumed at his demotion, raging to his diary that he had been “thrown to the wolves.” One of his great regrets was that he no longer enjoyed the favor of his old friend Frank. The loss of status gnawed at him. He retired by the end of 1944, and after writing a memoir that failed to find a publisher, mostly concentrated on breeding race horses, which usually lost. To the end of his life, according to his biographer, Neil Rolde, he never acknowledged, or apparently even realized, the magnitude of what he had done.

And yet even after the horrors of the Nazi regime were fully revealed, Johnson-Reed wasn’t overturned for another two decades. The law that replaced it, the Hart-Cellar Act of 1965, is often celebrated as the moment that America opened its doors to the world. At the time, though, its authors had more modest goals. Shamed into action by the civil rights movement, they planned to abolish the racial quotas and create a merit system allowing for limited immigration from outside of Europe.

It was only a last-minute nativist intervention that turned the law into something very different. An antsy Democratic congressman named Michael Feighan secured a provision allowing people to qualify through family ties as well—reasoning that since most immigrants were white, it would protect the racial status quo. “The bill that we sign today is not a revolutionary bill,” President Lyndon Johnson promised. “It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society,” Senator Ted Kennedy agreed.","['wall', 'visas', 'trump', 'refugees', 'roosevelt', 'months', 'visa', 'immigration', 'law', 'country', 'immigrants', 'long']",

THE PLANETʼS DENSEST EMBODIMENT of international cooperation lies in the heart of Geneva, in the few square miles around the lake. From the lakeshore, a brief walk through a park will bring a visitor to the Palace of Nations, built in the 1930s as the seat of the League of Nations, and now the United Nations’ office in the city. To the east, the World Trade Organization; to the north-west, the World Health Organization; an amble away, the headquarters of the Red Cross, the International Labour Organization, the International Telecommunications Union, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, among dozens of others. Also nearby is the InterContinental Hotel, where in November 2013, Iran agreed to dilute its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief—the first edition of the pact that President Donald Trump abandoned last year.

It’s entirely fitting that just down the road from the InterContinental is the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, which occupies a complex named Maison de la Paix, its six buildings arranged like strewn flower petals. The InterContinental is of particular interest to Thomas Biersteker, a political scientist at the Institute, who has made a career studying sanctions. Biersteker, an American who taught at Brown University until 2007, is prone to discussing the antics of nation-states in a tone of wry curiosity, as if relaying the activities of ant colonies in his backyard. He lives for part of the year in a house in the Swiss Alps, where he hosts so many discussions on his preferred topic that his colleagues call it the “Sanctions Chalet.” Typically, Biersteker’s case studies deal with bad actors: states gone rogue, dangerous leaders thumbing their noses at the world. Increasingly, though, these descriptions seem to fit not just autocracies flush with oil or tinpot dictatorships but also the United States of America.

Under Trump, America is in the business of actively creating or deepening threats to the world: capsizing the climate; pardoning U.S. soldiers and military contractors convicted of war crimes; supplying arms to Saudi Arabia, so that the kingdom can bombard Yemen. For a while, it looked as if Trump might attack North Korea; it’s still possible that he will start a war with Iran. In recently leaked memos, Kim Darroch, the former British ambassador to the U.S., worried that Trump would wreck world trade. Along the way, his administration has trashed so many diplomatic rules and norms that the entire edifice of postwar multilateralism is at risk. ( 1 ) A low point was Mike Pompeo’s speech last December in Brussels, when he attacked the European Union, the UN, and every other kind of multilateralism that the U.S. once championed. “There was a stunned silence after the speech,” said Anthony Gardner, a former American ambassador to the EU, “and then he left right away without taking questions.” Two years ago, Mary Robinson, a former UN special envoy on climate change, called the U.S. “a rogue state” for quitting the Paris accord. It’s common now for foreign policy professionals from America’s traditional allies to murmur brokenly about the “rules-based order,” as if they were standing at the bedside of a dear, dying friend.

Everyone on the front lines of foreign policy has stories to tell of chaos and breakdown. In one minor but telling exemplar of the genre, UN officials were shocked last summer when the U.S. abruptly decided to stop contributing $300 million—less than 0.6 percent of its foreign aid spend—to the Relief and Works Agency’s budget for Palestinian refugees. The agency began its work in 1949, to assist Palestinians who’d newly been rendered homeless; with successive generations, its beneficiaries have swelled to around 5.4 million, many of whom still live in or near refugee camps. “The U.S never had a problem with that number, until last year,” one UN official told me. “Then they made the argument that the funding should be pegged to the original number of some 800,000 refugees.” The U.S. refused to budge, despite multiple meetings, including one in mid-August that lasted 15 hours—so long that, after the building’s cafes shut at 5:30 p.m., delegates had to leave the premises altogether to find food. These gatherings rarely conclude without some sort of consensus, or at least some ambiguous language to project unanimity, the official said. But in this case, even that wasn’t an option; America’s dissent had to be recorded in a footnote before the meeting could move on.

A political scientist compared the present incarnation of the U.S. to “a large, powerful, overgrown child with a handgun. How do you deal with that?”

There are so many “egregious examples” of this kind, Wendy Sherman, the undersecretary of state for political affairs during the Obama administration, told me. “To the point that our allies, European leaders, are looking elsewhere for solidarity.” A Canadian political scientist who advised her country during last year’s NAFTA renegotiations was sickened when Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum using a provision for national security considerations. “What that meant to Canadians was: We are a threat to the national security of the U.S.” She described Trump’s actions as “brutal” and “an enormous betrayal” and added: “There was a growing sense that we were foolish to believe in the trust between the two countries.”

This is an unfamiliar situation for everyone. David Sylvan, a political scientist and one of Biersteker’s colleagues, compared the present incarnation of the U.S. to “a large, powerful, overgrown child with a handgun. How do you deal with that?” The U.S. has never hesitated to make up the rules for itself, but after the end of World War II, it was largely cast as a hegemon maintaining a global order. Now, it is a hegemon that scorns that order. More and more, the world fears that Trump is only a symptom of a much deeper problem, said James Davis, an American political scientist at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. European politicians in particular, he said, worry that deep social trends in America—towards chauvinism, insularity and coercion—will keep blooming even after Trump leaves the White House. Other governments “aren’t going to be willing to deal with you on the same terms again,” Davis added. “They won’t trust the system. They’ll worry that in a few years, there will be another explosion.”

So the question is worth asking: How much longer will it be before the rest of the world thinks about punishing the U.S. for its misdemeanors? And how would they even go about disciplining a country as mighty as the United States?

On a rainy April day, in a conference room in one of the petals of the Maison de la Paix, Biersteker convened for me a roundtable of a dozen or so sanctions scholars: practitioners, academics, researchers, economists. Few of them agreed to be quoted by name. Some worked with multilateral institutions and were attending in their personal capacities; a couple were Iranian, and unwilling to be linked to criticism of the U.S. Together, they proposed scenarios in which America’s misbehavior might pose genuine threats to the world, and speculated about how the international community could respond with sanctions, in the very widest sense of that word.

Through the spring, I spoke to other experts as well, in Geneva, London, Hamburg, New York and Washington D.C. The world is changing, they all said. The American unipolar moment is ending. The economies of China and India will soon outgrow America’s. New networks of power, trade and wealth are emerging. Countries are forming alternative arrangements of finance that fall outside American influence. These developments will eventually leave the U.S. vulnerable to levers of pressure in a way it hasn’t been in the past. In the corridors of power in Brussels, Paris and Berlin, the idea of pushing these levers is beginning to sound less and less outlandish by the day.","['rogue', 'american', 'scientist', 'war', 'state', 'treated', 'political', 'americas', 'trump', 'international', 'deal', 'world', 'sanctions']",
49,[],"In a just world, Paul Coates would not be famous primarily for the work of his son. As the father of Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose analysis of American history has transformed the public discourse on race, the 72-year-old Coates is immortalized in his son’s writing as an eccentric and quixotic figure.

PRINT THIS STORY

“My father was haunted,” Ta-Nehisi wrote in his first book, The Beautiful Struggle. “He’d explain to anyone who’d listen” that those in power “infected our minds. They deployed their phrenologists, their backward Darwinists, and forged a false Knowledge to keep us down. But against this demonology, there were those who battled back. Universities scorned them. Compromised professors scoffed at their names. So they published themselves and hawked their Knowledge at street fairs, churches, and bazaars. For their efforts, they were forgotten.”

Paul himself was largely forgotten by the time his son gained prominence, but in my hometown of Baltimore, his legacy and impact on the city have been profound. After leading the local chapter of the Black Panther Party in the late 1960s and early ’70s, he founded a prison literacy program, opened a bookstore devoted to community service and established the publishing company Black Classic Press to disseminate the work of contemporary authors like Walter Mosley and historic writers like W.E.B. Du Bois, John G. Jackson and Carter Woodson.

Although Coates and I have friends in common, we had never met until late last year, when we began a series of conversations about his life and political evolution. The first interview took place on Christmas, a holiday he doesn’t observe. “I resent it because it takes money out of the community,” he said. “It reflects a powerlessness to make decisions about what's in our best interest.” As the discussion, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, stretched into the evening and continued for months to come, we talked about his unlikely path from childhood poverty to the Vietnam War to the Panther Party. At a time when the country, and Baltimore in particular, face existential challenges, few people offer such a clear-eyed perspective on the past and the road ahead.

Yup. Voted for Trump and still loves him. You two met in the Panthers, right?

Yeah, he and his brother lived a few blocks from our headquarters. They were community supporters, selling papers and things like that.

Did anyone else from that circle go MAGA?

Not that I know of, but they wouldn’t tell me!

[1] Here’s the criminally boiled-down version of one of the great philosophical divides of the 20th century: Booker T. Washington encouraged black people to accept the injustice of segregation and focus on self-reliance. W.E.B. Du Bois condemned this as a “surrender,” arguing that black Americans “must unceasingly and firmly oppose” discrimination. He also told me a while back that he’s no longer on the Du Bois side of the debate with Washington.

Well, that is different. I’m a Booker T. Washington supporter and have been for many years.

Seriously?

Booker T. Washington was not the person that society imagines him to be, this big Uncle Tom. What he advocated is really black nationalism, if you think about it. The largest black nationalist figure in history is Marcus Garvey—he claimed 6 million followers around the world; he unified the people that became the African National Congress; every damn flag that you see in Africa with red, black and green is related to him—and Marcus Garvey came to America to learn from Booker T. Washington.

But Washington was cool with second-class citizenship. He wouldn’t fight for equal rights. He was basically running around telling people to pull their pants up.

The thing is, “pull your pants up” runs through the whole black nationalist movement. This is one of the differences my son and I have. His breakout article was on Bill Cosby and the pound cake routine, right? [2] Speaking at an NAACP ceremony in 2004, Cosby blamed the culture in poor black communities for their disadvantages. “These people are going around stealing Coca-Cola,” he said. “People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake.” A few days later, Ta-Nehisi responded in The Village Voice, dismissing the speech as “a relentless attack on poor and working-class African Americans” and dubbing Cosby “the patron saint of black elitists.” Folks want to attack Bill Cosby for hating black people in that speech. But people from my generation understood what Bill Cosby was saying. He would have been on the side of Booker T. Washington, yes. But I’d have been there, too. Booker T. Washington was all about the empowerment of the community. The major organization of black business in his time was the National Negro Business League—those folks were not talking about handouts from white people. A few years after he died, the first thing the Urban League wants is handouts from white people!

This is one of the strange things about American discourse: We have all these new platforms, but they flatten the conversation. Like you could spend a long time on Black Twitter without seeing anybody defend the pound cake speech—it’s completely discredited. But half the old black guys I know think Cosby was right.

I would say that most black people are conservative. We’re seen as radical when we demand the same values that America claims to have, but as a whole, we’re one of the largest bodies of conservatism in the country.

Did you grow up with politics?

Not at all, man. The civil rights movement was on television, but what was around me did not appear to be the same thing. My father had a radio and television repair shop in West Philadelphia, and I was born above it. There were a number of other children. I don’t even know how many. At one point, I could count at least 14 brothers and sisters. Four of us were by my mother, but my father also had children by two of my mother’s sisters. He was older than all of them. My mother was about 15 when he was 37, and my aunts were all young when he was with them. So he had a thing for young women. He took advantage of them. After my parents split, one of my aunts lived with my father. My brother and I went to live with them, because my mother really couldn't take care of us.

“My family always treated me as the gifted one. They felt I was different, and they treated me different. Even as a child, I was aware of that. Like I was special.”

How was your relationship with your aunt?

She was my first protector, that’s the way I think about her. She would battle my father. He was hard as hell on me. I mean, he would brutalize me. But she was fierce. A short, beautiful black woman who thought nothing about jumping in to save my ass. And she saved my ass a bunch of times. She took ass-whuppings for it.

Coates' mother, Edna, on the right. COURTESY OF PAUL COATES

Were they the only adults in that house?

Yeah, it was just her, him and my brothers and sisters. My father was on a decline. Alcoholism tore him up and his health wasn’t good. When I was 8 or 9, we finally got evicted. Then we lived out of my father’s truck for a while. I didn’t go to school during that period. We would park by a formstone wall at this graveyard and spend the night. My father, my aunt and my sister Judy would sleep in the front. My brothers and I slept in the back with a tarp pulled over so it wouldn’t rain on us. Eventually, my father brought us back to my mother. We couldn’t stay in the truck any longer.

Did you return to school?

I did, but I didn't really care for it.

How did your parents and teachers see you?

That’s an interesting question, because my family always treated me as the gifted one. They felt I was different, and they treated me different. Even as a child, I was aware of that. Like I was special. They always held me up. They always listened to me.

Did you rebel against your parents as you got older?

After my father dropped us off that one time, I never saw him again.

Ever?

That’s right. It was hard, because he had promised to come back. But he was an alcoholic. He had no way of taking care of himself, so I can understand it through that lens. My brother told me that he used to watch us at a distance. He met my sister and one of my older brothers a number of times on the street.

He just ran into them?

Yeah, but I didn’t know that until many years later. I never saw him. It felt like a broken promise. But I didn't want to be a part of all the conversations where the family ran him down. I didn't feel that way about him. I loved him. I really loved him.

What was the neighborhood like?

It was between gangs, so if you went this way, you'd be in one gang territory; if you went that way, you’d be in another gang’s; and if you went another way, you’d be in a whole other gang’s territory. We had to learn how to walk a certain way that sent a message: Don’t fuck with this. People would judge you on that bop.

What made you leave for the Army?

There was something about the people who came back from the service. They had a focus. They were about something. My friend and I wanted that, so we took the Army test right before I turned 18.

What did you pick for a military occupation?

They gave me three choices. I could be regular military police, a military police guard or a military police dog handler. I wasn’t going to be regular military police, and I thought about being a guard—but that was in White Sands, New Mexico, and something about “white sands” did not sound right. So I became a dog handler.

Did you have much experience with dogs?

No, I was terrified of them. I had been jumped when I was little by a Great Dane. He just licked me, but I still remember being terrified by that.

Were you nervous about going into a predominantly white space?

I didn't think about it until I got there. Color had never occurred to me. When I saw John Wayne on the television, I didn’t notice there weren't any black people with him.

Did you identify with John Wayne?

Yeah, I did. This is our country—kill some Japs. Anybody that gets in the way of the flag, they’ve gotta be wiped out. But once I got into the military, I was immediately confronted by racism. I remember this one draftee going down to Fort Knox with us on the train. We talked for hours, and I'd never really had a long, intimate conversation with a white person before. But then another black guy said something about his sister looking good, and the whole conversation went from here to there. He said something like he would do black girls, but…

But he didn’t want a black guy with his sister.

Like that would be insane. It actually stopped the conversation. People all drifted away. That was my first real experience with whiteness. It was like, “Oh, I get it now.”

“The racism was subtle—but as your consciousness expands, the subtlety melts away and the racism becomes more rancid to the eyes and nose.” Paul (second from left) in Vietnam. COURTESY OF PAUL COATES

Was there a lot of bigotry in the Army?

At one point, I had a run-in with a Native American guy. He was like a toy to the white boys. They would mess with him and call him Chief. He resented that, but then he started with me, saying, “Nigga-nigga-nigga.” We got to tussling and then another guy finally separated us. I remember he said to him, “Chief, what the fuck is wrong with you? He’s a nigger, and you’re an injun.” Right after that, I walked into another room and saw the book Black Boy, by Richard Wright, sitting out. I thought they had set me up. I had read some Baldwin and other black books, but I had never heard of Black Boy. I picked it up and saw that it was a real book, so I started reading it. That really did something to me. It became clear that I didn’t know a goddamn thing about black folks.

Baldwin didn’t make the same impression?

He didn’t. I had probably read at least three of his books, but it really didn’t jell that this was a genre until I read Wright. Then it all made sense, and it occurred to me that there must be other books like this out there. I committed myself to read every black book that I could possibly find.

Where were you stationed?

I was at Fort Wolters, a small base outside of Mineral Wells, Texas. That was my last base before I went to Vietnam.

What was rural Texas like?

There weren’t white cats in hoods, burning crosses and beating up on black people, but if you walked through town, the moment you got to the black side, the sidewalks would disappear, the streets would disappear, and now you’re walking in dirt. So the racism was subtle—but as your consciousness expands, the subtlety melts away and the racism becomes more rancid to the eyes and nose.

How did you feel about the war?

When you’re in the military, the only thing coming at you is military information. It’s just like being in America: You are totally brainwashed. Everything around me supported the war in Vietnam, so I bought into it.

It’s amazing that you were experiencing racism and discovering black writers at the same time the civil rights movement was accelerating, but your identity as a soldier was strong enough to overshadow your identity as a black man.

My consciousness was so underdeveloped, though. I was just beginning to see things. I didn’t even have the right questions yet, let alone the answers.

How long were you in Vietnam?

I did a 13-month stay, then I got a 30-day leave and went back for two months. Our job was maintaining the perimeter at night. We were supposed to patrol an area of about two miles with the dogs, but very few of us did that. It would have been suicide. We would gather at a place where the patrols intersected, instead. I usually went to sleep.

Did you go back to Philly when you got out?

I went there at first, but then I moved down to Baltimore a few months later.

Which part of town?

The first place was the YMCA, because I ran into a lot of racism trying to get an apartment. God damn.

Baltimore is one of the most segregated cities in America.

Of course it is. It still is. I had a couple of addresses, and the people wouldn’t open the doors. I remember going to one house that had a room for rent, and I knocked on the door and this old white woman came out and when I asked about the room, she said, “No, not your kind.”

Subtle.

What do you say to a woman who says that to you? I think about it often. That woman is probably dust now, but she still lives with me.

How did Baltimore compare to Philly?

Folks down here loved to hear about the black books I was reading. In Philadelphia, that stuff separated me from my family, but here they embraced me. I found the New Era bookstore on Mulberry Street, and then up from that was a communist bookstore, and there was a newsstand on Greenmount Avenue with black books—and then there was Walter Lively’s store, Liberation Bookstore. When I found that, I was in heaven. I could go in there, and all these people were having political conversations. I didn’t understand half of what they were talking about, but it was like I had arrived in the promised land. It was different from anything I had known.

Did you get involved with political organizations?

I tried to. I didn’t know there were people in Baltimore affiliated with the big groups, but I heard that SNCC [3] The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, founded at the historically black Shaw University in 1960 and brought to national prominence by activist Stokely Carmichael a few years later. was on U Street in D.C. So I went there one morning, but they were gone. The same thing happened with the Southern Leadership Conference and the Republic of New Afrika—they had all moved locations by the time I decided to go.

Did you understand the differences between those groups and the Panthers?

I did. I mean, I was prepared to join any of them, but one thing I liked about the Panthers was that their approach didn’t make white people into devils. I thought that whatever we did in this country, we had to find the white people who were willing to join ranks with us. That was my thinking, just numerically. I wasn’t about black nationalism. So when I stepped inside the Panther circle, I agreed with what they said.

Coates during his time leading the Baltimore chapter of the Black Panthers. COURTESY OF PAUL COATES

Did the Baltimore chapter of the Panthers monitor police activity? [4] The Black Panther Party was first established in Oakland, California, after the 1966 killing of an unarmed black teen by police. Panthers began following patrol cars, armed with shotguns, to observe arrests and bear witness to police brutality.

If somebody was getting busted, you were supposed to observe that. But we didn’t spend time trailing cops around. We had other things, like the breakfast program. [5] In 1969, the Panthers in Oakland created a program to offer free breakfast for schoolchildren. It would eventually provide daily meals to more than 10,000 students.

I’ve always admired how proactive the Panthers were. They didn’t just have meetings. They went out in the community and got shit done.

Yeah, it was less standing around in a black jacket and beret, more selling newspapers to fund programs. The hardest job we had was trying to keep oil in the furnace and food on the table for the Panthers and their kids. Also getting people out of jail, you know, and taking care of people who came to us for protection. I remember this one woman who was being harassed by white bullies, and our job was to go down there and protect her. There was always something like that, whether it was organizing the boycott of a racist store or helping people get their electricity back on.

Do you think the FBI really believed the Panthers were a national security threat? [6] In 1969, the director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, declared that “the Black Panther Party, without question, represents the greatest threat to the internal security of the country.”

George Jackson [7] Jackson emerged as an influential author and activist for prison reform in the 1960s. He was killed by guards at San Quentin while attempting to escape in 1971, and was memorialized in a Bob Dylan song bearing his name. wrote that that fascism could not tolerate any threat, direct or implied, and the federal government is the same way. The fact that we could stand up and say “Fuck the government” was a threat. They wanted to know, “Who said that? And why would he say that? Who else around him says it?” The Panthers came under Hoover’s whole motivating principle of preventing a black messiah. He designed it for Martin Luther King, but the Panthers fit into it. You have to remember, he had been doing this since 1917, 1918. That’s how he saw the world. Here’s the question, though: How much of a threat were the Panthers, really?

That’s what I mean—they obviously weren’t a national security threat, but they were a threat in the sense that they were educating people to question authority.

I agree, but at the same time, the FBI did not destroy the Panthers. I’m not one who ascribes the destruction of the Black Panther Party just to COINTELPRO. [8] COINTELPRO was a covert FBI operation, running from 1956 until 1971, to undermine American organizations that the federal government regarded as “subversive.” Among its targets were peace activists, animal rights groups, environmentalists and civil rights leaders, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. They were a large factor, but the Panthers also destroyed themselves. Most people don’t look at the forces that were internal. They might talk about how Huey went to jail and got messed up in jail, but Huey was a gangster before he went to jail—and if he hadn’t gone to jail, his gangsterism might have brought an even earlier end to the Panthers. Instead, he comes out of jail and does the things that people do when they’re street like that. [9] Huey P. Newton, who co-founded the Panthers with Bobby Seale, was convicted of killing an Oakland police officer in 1967. He was released in 1970, but his struggles with drug addiction and paranoia contributed to fractures within the organization. He was a brilliant guy, and he put some important things in place, but he fell victim to the same things that all people fall victim to.

Who was the Defense Captain [10] The official name for the leader of a Panther chapter. in Baltimore?

Well, the chapter here was founded by an agent of the National Security Agency, Warren Hart, so he was the first. Then the Panthers sent John Clark, but it wasn’t long before he was in jail, too. They were arresting everybody, man.

What did you get arrested for?

Crazy-ass John Clark called me up one morning. He goes, “Coates, Coates, we need you! The pigs got us all surrounded, man! We’ve gotta move some TE.” [11] Technical Equipment, a euphemism for weapons. I was thinking, You’re telling me this on the phone? You have to remember, this is just after Fred was killed and the L.A. shootout. [12] He's talking about Fred Hampton, the 21-year-old chairman of the Illinois Panthers. On the morning of December 4, 1969, police in Chicago raided his apartment and shot him in his sleep. The FBI was later found to have orchestrated the raid.



As for the L.A. shootout: Four days after Hampton’s death, police in L.A. broke down the front door of the local Panthers headquarters to execute a search warrant. The Panthers opened fire, killing three officers, and a battle began. Over the next four hours, police showered the building with gunfire and tried to blow the roof open with dynamite, while Panthers in gas masks returned fire with submachine guns through a haze of tear gas. I knew the FBI was obviously listening on the phone, but I had to go—if I didn’t, I would have been labeled an informer or an agent. It was a fucked-up situation. So I jump out of bed, throw on my shirt from the night before and go down to our headquarters. The block was empty. No traffic, no cops, no nothing—but he wants to go to the house with the guns and bring them back to our headquarters, because it was fortified. So we get there, but we don’t have a key. And this is John Clark—crazy as shit. He had somebody kick in the basement window, go in and open up the door. We end up taking all the guns out of the house. I’m the last person coming out. I have one gun, a rifle, in my hand. It’s not loaded, but I’m coming out of the house and I see John and all the other Panthers lined up with handcuffs. The police are hollering for me to drop the gun, drop the gun. And John is hollering at me, “Drop the gun, Coates! What the fuck’s wrong with you?” But I'm not dropping the gun, because I’m scared as shit they’re going to kill me. I’m saying, I’m not going to drop the gun until they lower their guns, you know? I think they would have killed me then, but they were in a semicircle around me and they couldn’t get a clear shot. So we negotiated, and I dropped the gun, and they arrested me, too. There were pictures of me being put in the car.

They took pictures?

Oh yeah, they had it all set up. There were television cameramen. I didn’t realize until I saw the footage a couple of years ago. But I wasn’t even a Panther yet, because you weren’t a Panther just by hanging around with Panthers. You had to get made a Panther—and so many informants came out of the woodwork in the congressional hearings [13] In 1970, the House Committee on Internal Security launched an investigation into several chapters of Panthers, including large ones in Detroit and Philadelphia. that they shut down membership. You could still become a Panther, but somebody had to make you one.

How did you get made?

After John Clark got out of jail, he went back to California—but the woman he was living with started trying to give the Party orders in his absence. She was from North Africa and she looked like she was white. As far as we were concerned, she was white. So I said, This is crazy. I went up to New York to deliver a report on the arrests, and I took her with me.

You were going to let New York hash it out?

It really wasn’t much hashing. I delivered my report and when she went to speak, they said, “Who the fuck are you? You ain’t no Panther.” Then Robert Bay [14] Originally a member of the Panthers in San Francisco, Bay rose quickly in the organization until his expulsion by Newton in 1970. asked me, “Who the fuck is left down there?” I said, “Ain’t nobody down there now. Everybody got arrested.” He said, “OK, Coates—that means you it.” I said, “I can’t be it. I’m not even a Panther.” And he said, “Well, you a motherfucking Panther now, and you in charge. So get your ass back down there and get those people on the street selling the newspapers.”

How did you feel about being in charge?

It wasn’t something I wanted. We didn't even have a chapter, really. At least three of our members were under murder charges. I had 15 attempted murder counts that came from the arrest before I went to New York. [15] Coates says that each count of attempted murder reflected one of the police officers who surrounded him in the standoff. And then I had numerous other little arrest charges. So I mean, I really wanted all that to go away. But I couldn’t walk away from all the people that were in jail.

It seems daunting.

But what would you do if you thought you could turn this shit around? If you could turn around 500 years of oppression? It may be daunting, but you would go for it! And the Panthers were the best shot.

What changes did you make as Defense Captain?

I was successful at not getting killed, so that’s a difference. I kept the chapter running for a year and a half, which was record time in the Panther Party. But my leadership style was just survival, because the Panthers stopped sending us support. Huey had this crazy-ass plan about taking over Oakland, and they were consolidating people out there. He had already brought Robert Bay from New York. I got called out there, too, but I didn’t know why. After I got there, Robert Bay said, “Coates, now we got your ass out here, we gonna break you.” Because he felt that I had a thing about Baltimore over the Black Panther Party—which I did, in the sense that I had a lot of brothers in jail, and they weren’t doing nothing about those people. I wanted to talk about bringing more support to Baltimore, but nobody would talk to me about that. It reached a point where I said, Fuck this.

What do you mean?

I just walked out the door. I had enough money to get on a bus, and I ended up trying to go to this sister's house, who I knew. But she had moved, so I was really up the creek then. Then I got on another bus, and I figured I would just ride the bus for a while until I got my head clear. And a few minutes later, I saw the Oakland Public Library and I got off. I knew what I would do. I went in the library, and I used the library to clear my head. Because books have always been good to me. It was like a sanctuary. When I got clear, I called people in Baltimore, asked them to send money for me to stay at the YMCA, and then I got a plane ticket and got out of there. I’m fortunate that I walked away before the Panthers transitioned into the organization that destroyed itself, because my difference with the Panther Party would have been met with mud-holing and getting beaten by bullwhips. [16] Violent tactics used by Panther leaders to discipline members. After Newton’s release from prison, these practices became more frequent and extreme. Some Panthers accused of disloyalty were assassinated or forced into exile.

Did you have a sense that breakdown was coming?

I remember being fearful. I was still 24. I remember thinking I wasn’t going to live to be 25. See, there was one cop that was killed in Baltimore, and there was another one that got shot. What the police did to convict Eddie Conway [17] A prominent Panther in Baltimore who was convicted of the 1970 shooting of two police officers. Conway was released in 2014 after an appellate court ruled that his jury was given faulty instructions. of this is they put an informant in the court that said I had ordered him to kill the cops. That I told him the only way to become a Panther was by killing the cops. And you have to remember, that was before I got made a Panther, and Eddie had been in the Party about a year or so—but they’re saying I gave him cough syrup and marijuana and told him, in order to become a Panther you have to kill a cop. So I took that as them setting me up to be killed by the police. That’s why I thought I wasn’t going to be 25. I didn’t think I could make it, especially once I was out of the Panthers.

What did you think your next move would be?

When I got back to Baltimore, I was in a haze. I didn’t know what the hell to do. You know, in the Black Panther Party, you had an ideology. Everything I thought came from the Party. You knew who the enemy was, and what you were supposed to think and say. When I left the Party, I didn’t have that anymore. I had three children with my wife, a fourth by a woman in the Panther Party, and another on the way with someone else in the Party. My life was a wreck, man. It was a wreck. How was I going to take care of these children?

Had you been living in a Panther apartment?

Yeah, so I didn’t have anywhere to go. The only place I had to live was with my wife, but she ended up throwing me out. [18] Coates and his first wife had been drifting apart for years. “We were at odds from day one,” he said. “She was not political, and I was becoming more and more political.” After that, one of the first things I did was to visit the Panthers who were still in prison. When you leave the Party, the people still in it are not supposed to have contact with you. So I told them I wasn’t with the Party anymore, but I would still be there for them. I would do whatever I could do outside of the Party. And what they decided was: Fuck the Party. They were going to roll with me. Because I still wanted to make change in the world. I was meeting with a group of radicals who wanted to support the brothers in jail that the Panther Party had abandoned, so I said, “Let’s create a bookstore and send them literature. When they come out, they can work in the bookstore—and we’ll publish books that will be sold in the bookstore.” [19] The bookstore and literacy program would eventually be known as the George Jackson Prison Movement, which Coates founded and ran for more than a decade. Because I still believed in the model of the Panthers, the radicalism of the Panthers. I believed that information was power. That’s what the Panther newspaper was about: speaking for ourselves. I wanted to do that with black books. They could affect the consciousness and have an impact on somebody. I consider black books to be soldiers. I consider them to be bullets.

You wanted the book project to replace the Panthers?

Yeah, and right after we set it up, the Panthers left the city—so the bookstore became an information center. Our storefront was right around the corner from where the Panthers had their office. We got people to come with books that we could bring into the prisons, and we held chicken dinners and crab feasts to raise money. We used whatever funds we had in the same way the Panthers did, and continued many of their programs. We helped people with rent, and I used to go around and pick up food donations from the people who had given to the Panthers. They thought the Panthers were still here—I never told them!

Was the FBI still watching you?

They were monitoring the bookstore, [20] An FBI report from November 7, 1973, noted that “a review of Baltimore files re the George Jackson Prison Movement, WILLIAM PAUL COATES, and REGINALD HOWARD fails to reveal any activity of an extremist nature; therefore, Baltimore is conducting no further investigation re this organization at this time.” but there was nothing to find. I was reading some FBI papers recently, and they even chronicled those crab feasts—talking about how successful they were, how we organized people around them. Because people could see that we were trying to do something.

Did it feel more stable than the Panthers?

Yeah, and I had hooked up with my second wife, who is Ta-Nehisi’s mother, about that time, so I had a stable base, a stable partner. I already had five children, but she said, “You have five children, but I have none.” So that’s when Ta-Nehisi was born. We moved the bookstore into the basement of our house, and then I went away to Atlanta University for graduate school in library science. My wife and I published our first book while I was there. It was called Survey Graphic. It’s a look at the Harlem Renaissance, and it’s still underappreciated. But I wanted to publish it while I was still in graduate school, because I felt if I could do that, I’d be able to do other books under stress. Eventually, we dropped the bookstore, but we kept the printing and publishing part of the vision, which is Black Classic Press. And we have been publishing books ever since. Our mission is to keep books in print by and about people of African descent.

It can’t be easy to run a publishing company right now.

We have challenges literally every day, but we’re entering year 41. The biggest issue now has to do with transition, because I’m getting older.

More Stories on Highline Millenials are screwed Why they’re facing the scariest financial future of any generation since the Great Depression. Together alone The epidemic of gay loneliness.

Do you want to keep the business in the family?

No, because this doesn’t belong to me. I didn’t do this for my family, and I’m not committed to success as a capitalist. I’m committed to my legacy as an institution-builder, empowering the community. If some of my children wanted to step up and continue the legacy, they could do that, but at this point, none of them do. I have seven biological children and two children through my third marriage, in 2010. All of them are readers, but they don’t necessarily appreciate books in the same way. They don’t appreciate the political context in the way I do. Ta-Nehisi does. He and I are very close in our political outlook. I’m close to all of my children. I love all of them, and all of them love me. But when it comes to political outlook, he’s the only one. Because Ta-Nehisi was subjected to me 24/7. My other kids could go to their mothers. He had no place to run! His younger brother Menelik is also different, because he’s a state prosecutor. So he’s on the other side—they put people in jail! But he deals mostly with white-collar crimes, so he says he went into criminal justice to give some parity.

What do you see as the legacy of the Panthers?

More than anything, they extended the notion of propaganda. The whole thing about “Seize the Time” and “Off the Pig”—those chants were powerful tools. I think there’s a parallel in the Black Lives Matter movement, but it’s completely different from the Panther Party.

“People criticize [Ta-Nehisi] for not having hope. But it’s not that you don’t have hope. It’s just: What would you base the hope on?”

BLM is definitely less centralized, but is that an advantage or a disadvantage?

I think the decentralization is a good thing, because none of those people are going to jail!

I guess it is difficult to target a movement without a clear leader.

It helps them avoid killing each other, too. In a centralized thing, if you don’t like the leader, you have to overpower him—but you can’t have a coup if there’s no leader. I’d have a difficult time even naming very many leaders in Black Lives Matter, but they have raised consciousness.

Of course, BLM is a response to the exact same problem that created the Panthers more than 50 years ago. Should we feel encouraged that the fight against police brutality continues, or discouraged that it still has to?

I don’t know. I really don’t know. The situation we find ourselves in didn’t happen overnight, and it’s not going to be solved overnight.

What do you make of the fact that two of the most visible black candidates in the 2020 race so far, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, are among the least progressive?

I’m not sure, but the race is still so early that it really doesn’t matter a lot who’s in it. The candidates at the edges are going to shape a standard that all of them have to meet, you know? I don’t think Barack Obama was that radical. I never thought it made any difference whether he got elected or Hillary Clinton. Symbolically, it did. But she probably would have made better decisions for black people. She would have had to be responsive to a black electorate, whereas Obama didn’t have to worry about that.

[21] A remark by Hillary Clinton in 1996 that some children involved in the drug trade were “not just gangs of kids,” but “superpredators” without conscience or empathy. In the context of the 1990s crime wave, the comment echoed tough-on-crime black leaders, but it would haunt Clinton 20 years later, when activists challenged her 2016 campaign by suggesting that the term “superpredator” revealed a dehumanizing attitude toward black kids. comment, she was partly catering to the black electorate. A lot of people forget this, but even when she made the “superpredator” comment, she was partly catering to the black electorate.

She was! She absolutely was. She was dancing to a tune largely called by the inner cities.

[22] One of two black-owned newspapers in Baltimore. The Times was founded by Joy and Peter Bramble in 1986; its primary competitor, The Baltimore Afro-American, has been in print since 1892. Do you know Peter Bramble? A certain constituency, anyway. The black clergy were all about bringing more police to the community. I was writing for The Baltimore Times back then.Do you know Peter Bramble?

I do.

He and Joy were both at the paper when I was there, but Peter left in the ’90s to become rector at St. Mark’s in Brooklyn. It’s one of the biggest black Episcopal churches in the country, but he ended up quitting over gay marriage. Just refused to do it. And I mean, I’ve known Peter forever. I just saw him the other day and I have a lot of love for the guy—but he’s like a lot of black clergy on this. Do you think your generation of leaders should have done more to ally with the gay movement?

I don't think so. I think our generation did exactly what we should have, because what we did is all we could have done. To project backward with the current level of consciousness that people have is not correct.

I guess it’s easy to forget how much the culture has changed since then—or even since the ’80s, when Ralph Northam [23] The governor of Virginia. Still. was running around in blackface.

You have to look at Northam then and now. I mean, I did things in the ’80s that I’m not proud of, too. I’d like to know who didn’t do things 30 years ago that they’re not proud of. Are we all saints?

A lot of people were surprised that so many black voters continued to support Northam, but I bet half the Virginia legislature has some racist shit in their past. He was just the idiot who got caught.

That’s right, he’s the one that got caught! What we have to focus on is: What is he doing now? What has he done in the immediate past? Because there are also people down there like Corey Stewart [24] The race-baiting loser of the 2018 Virginia Senate race. He said that people who want to take down Confederate statues are “just like ISIS.” who maybe didn’t dress up like the Ku Klux Klan, but he’s a cold-up racist. Just like we don’t need a picture of Donald Trump in a Klan robe to know who he is—and that’s now, not 35 years ago. So the robe and blackface, as far as I’m concerned, are problems—but I want to know what you did when you took that robe off. Because I don’t know what Ralph Northam understood at the time, but if he still doesn’t get it, that’s a problem.

And plenty of white people don’t. You still hear, “Why can’t my kid be LeBron for Halloween? He loves LeBron!” Without any recognition of the history that connects to, the minstrelsy, mockery, disparagement. Things like that make me wonder how far we’ve actually come.

It’s a sobering question, and it brings to mind Ta-Nehisi. People criticize him for not having hope. But it’s not that you don’t have hope. It’s just: What would you base the hope on?

Right, because a lot of shit is actually worse. The murder rate here is up 50 percent from a few years ago, even though the city is shrinking. We’re sending more and more black men to prison, the school system is a disgrace…

Yeah, I know—this may not work. We might not actually be able to change anything. But we have to keep working for change, supporting things that are progressive and fighting against things that are regressive. We’ve got to keep struggling. I don’t think we have a choice. I know we don’t have a better choice.","['exceptional', 'baltimore', 'life', 'party', 'didnt', 'black', 'think', 'dont', 'talking', 'coates', 'paul', 'know', 'panthers', 'went', 'panther']",
