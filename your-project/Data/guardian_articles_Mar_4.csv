0,['Daniel Boffey'],"If Lord Frost were seeking to put a marker down on how he would engage with the EU, it wasn’t necessary. His robust style is well appreciated in Brussels after a tumultuous year of trade and security talks, including the first attempt to break international law by violating the terms of the withdrawal agreement through the infamous internal market bill.

There is then some confusion in Brussels and Dublin at Wednesday’s announcement about trade at the border between Northern Ireland, which in effect remains in the single market for goods, with the rest of the UK firmly outside.

The government announced that rather than impose a range of red-tape and checks due to come into force on 1 April under the withdrawal agreement, they would unilaterally extend until October grace periods on paperwork relating to parcels from Britain and goods heading to the shelves of Northern Ireland’s supermarkets.

That might be a perfectly sensible thing to do. UK officials said it was simply a reflection businesses and border systems in Northern Ireland were not yet ready for the consequences of the full-fat Brexit, and in light of the special circumstances in Northern Ireland, it was necessary to take some pragmatic steps to ease people’s understandable frustration. Loyalist paramilitary groups have let it be known they have withdrawn their support for the Good Friday agreement in protest at Northern Ireland’s Irish Sea trade border with the rest of the UK, which has caused genuine issues already.

Yet, what is confusing to many EU officials, is that this move was done unilaterally – and now.

At the very last meeting of the joint EU-UK committee looking at all these issues, the British side had come away confident that agreement on an extension of grace periods would be found. The EU, led by the European commission’s vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, had made a few demands. They wanted to know more about the UK’s long-term plan with respect to supermarkets and their suppliers and were seeking additional investment in digital solutions for traders.

Arlene Foster, the first minister of Northern Ireland, had been fiery in the meeting, memorably saying of the checks that had been done at the border, “not a sausage” of a problem had been uncovered in terms of risks to health and safety. The ruling DUP’s position is that the whole idea of checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK remains a constitutional outrage and is a nonsense given the lack of divergence between UK and EU standards.

But sources who attended the meeting felt nevertheless there was an unsaid quid pro quo: if the UK could firm up how it planned to ensure EU border requirements were met while keeping a Tescos in Enniskillen as well stocked with British products as one in Enfield, then further time could be found before the full gamut of checks would be imposed at the border.

Why, then, EU officials ask, move ahead with what the commission believes is a second attempt to break international law, echoing the most contentious clauses of the internal market bill tabled last year?

One of the consequences is that the European parliament has engaged in some sabre rattling over whether it will ratify the trade and security deal which is only provisionally in force and would fall away without MEPs backing. The EU has also threatened legal action through the European court of justice. Being taken to court for failing to live up to the obligations of an international treaty is not necessarily the greatest advert for global Britain as it seeks trade deals around the world, including with the US, where the president, Joe Biden, has in the past made public his interest in what happens in Northern Ireland.

The UK insists the EU is overreacting. The move they made is technical, not political. But the EU is not convinced. As ever, it looks to the internal politics of Westminster for answers and it has been a tricky patch for the former UK negotiating team.

Frost’s former deputy Oliver Lewis resigned after being accused by the prime minister of briefing against Gove. Frost himself was supposed to be given the job of national security adviser this year but was handed a new role of Brexit and international policy representative without any real levers to pull. He reportedly threatened to resign unless he was given genuine powers, after which he was elevated to the cabinet.

Frost then may not have had to convince the EU of his pugnacious character, but perhaps he did need to remind the prime minister of his value to him? If so, we shall have to see at what cost. But as the trade and security talks showed, he is happy to push matters to the edge.","['agreement', 'eu', 'northern', 'security', 'lord', 'uk', 'border', 'checks', 'does', 'delay', 'ireland', 'loyalty', 'international', 'deal', 'signify', 'frosts', 'trade']"
1,['Patrick Wintour'],"A potential roadblock to talks between Iran and the US on the future of the nuclear deal has been cleared after the UN nuclear inspectorate said it had won Iran’s agreement to return to Tehran to hold focused talks on doubts over the veracity of the country’s previous declarations about its nuclear sites.

Rafael Grossi, the director general of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran and IAEA inspectors had been talking past each other, with Iran failing to provide credible answers to the inspectorate’s questions. He said he had decided “we either continue with this merry-go-round or try something else”.

He said Iran had now agreed to take part in direct, focused technical meetings at the beginning of April, with the aim for inspectors of reporting back to an IAEA board meeting in June.

The agreement reached over the past 48 hours means European countries will not go ahead with plans to table a censure motion against Iran at an IAEA board meeting on Friday.

Iran had said it would in effect end its cooperation with the IAEA if the motion went ahead, which would have damaged hopes of starting informal talks between Iran and the US over how both sides could come back into compliance with the deal.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had warned his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, that the chances of reviving the nuclear deal would collapse without a clear gesture from Iran.

In response to Iran’s offer to clarify its disclosures, Europe said it would hold off on its censure motion to give time for diplomacy.

Iran has said it will not hold talks with the US if sanctions remain in place, and the US says it will not hold talks until Iran takes further steps to come back into compliance.

Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Saeed Khatibzadeh, said: “Today’s developments can keep open the path of diplomacy initiated by Iran and the IAEA.”

The Iranian ambassador to the IAEA, Kazem Gharib Abadi, tweeted that “due to extensive diplomatic consultations … a glimpse of hope is looming to prevent unnecessary tension”.

This week a report in the Iranian Vatan-e-Emrouz newspaper said Tehran had “temporarily suspended the production of uranium metal on the order of [Rouhani]”. The government in Tehran has not disputed the accuracy of the report.

The production of uranium metal goes against a 15-year ban in the nuclear deal on “producing or acquiring plutonium or uranium metals or their alloys”. Grossi said he had not been informed by Iran about anything related to uranium metal.

Iran says the uranium metal production is part of its plans to provide advanced fuel for a research reactor in Tehran.

Grossi did not go into details as to why he thought his new technical process would bring more credible responses than those provided so far, but he is clearly determined not to see the process abandoned prematurely.

Late last month Iran suspended some IAEA inspections as US sanctions had not yet been lifted, which was described by Grossi as a “huge loss” for the agency. However, after two days of talks between Grossi and Iranian officials in Tehran, a three-month arrangement was agreed under which Iran pledged to keep recordings “of some activities and monitoring equipment” and hand them over to the IAEA as and when US sanctions are lifted.

Grossi said the IAEA had a series of unanswered questions, but he did not go into the details. It has been previously reported that Iran might be drilling a uranium metal disc that experts say could be used to create material for a neutron initiator, a key component of a nuclear weapon. A second suspicion was that nuclear material had been introduced at a site where Iran may have tested high explosives that can be used to detonate a nuclear weapon.

The agency is also asking Iran about another undeclared site where illicit uranium conversion and processing may have taken place, it said.","['hold', 'iranian', 'roadblock', 'iaea', 'tehran', 'potential', 'talks', 'nuclear', 'grossi', 'deal', 'clear', 'uranium', 'iran', 'metal']"
2,['Damian Carrington'],"People waste almost a billion tonnes of food a year, a UN report has revealed. It is the most comprehensive assessment to date and found waste was about double the previous best estimate.

The food discarded in homes alone was 74kg per person each year on average around the world, the UN found. In the UK, which has some of the best data, the edible waste represents about eight meals per household each week.

The UN report also includes data on food waste in restaurants and shops, with 17% of all food dumped. Some food is lost on farms and in supply chains as well, meaning that overall a third of food is never eaten.

The waste damages efforts to help the billions of people who are either hungry or cannot afford a healthy diet, but also harms the environment. Food waste and loss causes about 10% of the emissions driving the climate emergency, and intensive farming is a key cause of the biodiversity crisis and global pollution.

If food waste was a country, it would have the third highest emissions after only the US and China. But the researchers said cutting food waste was one of the easiest ways for people to reduce their environmental impact. “Yet this potential has been woefully underexploited,” said the report.

Food waste had been thought of as a problem mostly affecting rich countries. But the UN report found levels of waste were surprisingly similar in all nations, though data is scarce in the poorest countries.

The researchers said nobody bought food with the intention of throwing it away and that small amounts discarded each day might seem insignificant. Therefore increasing people’s awareness of waste was key, they said, such as via separate food waste collections by local authorities.

Government and corporate action was needed, but individual action was important, the experts said, such as measuring portions of rice and pasta, checking the fridge before shopping and increasing cooking skills to use what was available. The greater time available for planning and cooking in homes during coronavirus lockdowns in the UK appears to have reduced waste by 20%.

“Reducing food waste would cut greenhouse gas emissions, slow the destruction of nature through land conversion and pollution, enhance the availability of food and thus reduce hunger and save money at a time of global recession,” said Inger Andersen, the head of the UN Environment Programme (Unep), which published the report. “Businesses, governments and citizens around the world have to do their part.”

Marcus Gover, the head of Wrap, an NGO that helped write the report, said: “We are so used to wasting food that we’ve forgotten its value, and the cost that feeding our growing global population has on the natural world. Like it or not, we in our homes are the most significant part of the problem.”

The report was produced to support global efforts to meet the UN’s sustainable development goal of halving food waste by 2030. It found 11% of all the food sold to consumers was wasted in homes in 2019, with restaurants discarding 5% and food shops dumping 2%.

Good data on household waste was available for countries representing 75% of the world’s population. Food waste includes edible and inedible parts, such as rinds and bones. The mix is about 50:50 in some high-income countries but unknown elsewhere.

“However, even if some of that waste can’t be consumed by humans, there are environmentally preferable ways in which it can be managed, [for example] by diverting it to animal feed or composting,” said Clementine O’Connor at Unep. “What we want to drive home is we need to get food waste out of landfills.”

“The UK has really taken a leading role in food waste reduction and is one of very few countries that has achieved a great reduction,” she added. Between 2007 and 2018, edible household food waste was cut by almost a third, according to Wrap, though overall food waste was still 19% in November 2020.

Carina Millstone, of the food campaign group Feedback, said the UN report was seminal and showed food waste action must be a high priority for governments ahead of the Cop26 climate summit in November: “As hosts, the UK must lead the way – it can do so by measuring and tackling food waste on farms, and by introducing mandatory food waste measurements and reduction targets for businesses.”

Wrap started a food waste action week in the UK on Monday to raise awareness of the issue and drive change. Nadiya Hussain, the chef and TV presenter, is a supporter. She said: “From avoiding buying or preparing too much to storing food correctly, the week is about helping people make the most of their food and helping protect our planet.”

Martina Otto, of Unep, said: “If you don’t take action on food waste, it’s a triple lose. It’s not only the food that we’re chucking out, but also all the natural and financial resources that went into producing that food. So let’s make it a triple win.”","['global', 'tonnes', 'waste', 'homes', 'uk', 'data', 'countries', 'food', 'action', 'wasting', 'world', 'reveals', 'report', '1bn']"
3,['Rajeev Syal'],"Priti Patel has reached a six-figure settlement with a senior civil servant following claims that he was forced out of his job for intervening in her alleged bullying of fellow staff, it has emerged.

Sir Philip Rutnam, the former permanent secretary in the Home Office, had threatened to take the home secretary to an employment tribunal hearing in September.

It was the first time that a secretary of state has been pursued to an employment tribunal by a former permanent secretary, the most senior civil servant in a government department.

Rutnam said in a statement issued through his union: “I am pleased to say that the government has today settled the claims that I brought against them and which were due to be heard in an employment tribunal in September.

“This settlement resolves my own case. The FDA is continuing to pursue in separate proceedings the wider issues that have been raised,” he said.

Patel will be under pressure to disclose the full amount paid out to settle the case as well as the costs. Rutnam was understood to have witnessed several incidents which he believed showed that the MP for Witham was bullying staff.

He resigned from his post as permanent secretary of the Home Office on 29 February 2020 and subsequently began legal proceedings against the Home Office.","['servant', 'secretary', 'reaches', 'rutnam', 'senior', 'proceedings', 'office', 'chief', 'exhome', 'tribunal', 'philip', 'permanent', 'settlement', 'sixfigure', 'patel', 'priti', 'employment']"
4,[],"Nicola Sturgeon has said she will “get on with the job” of steering Scotland out of the coronavirus pandemic, as she accused opposition parties of prejudging the outcome of inquiries into her and her government’s conduct in relation to the investigation into sexual harassment allegations against Alex Salmond.

During angry exchanges at first minister’s questions on Thursday, Sturgeon told the Scottish Conservatives’ leader in Holyrood, Ruth Davidson: “I’m going to get on with the job that I suspect most people watching at home right now want me to get on with, which is leading this country through and out of a pandemic.”

A day after her marathon eight-hour evidence session to the Holyrood inquiry that is examining the Scottish government’s handling of the original complaints by two female civil servants, Sturgeon was challenged by opposition leaders about the last-minute release of the legal advice to the committee.

Despite two votes in parliament, the legal advice given to the Scottish government about Salmond’s judicial review of the process, which it lost at a cost of more than £600,000 to taxpayers, was only released to the committee the day before Sturgeon’s evidence, after the Scottish Conservatives threatened a no-confidence vote in the deputy first minister, John Swinney.

There remain outstanding documents that Swinney has undertaken to release on Thursday, and the no-confidence motion remains live, as does one that the Tories have also threatened against Sturgeon.

Davidson asked Sturgeon why her government had continued to “defend the indefensible” when government lawyers expressed significant concerns about the case.

The papers released on Tuesday evening contained the explosive revelation that Roddy Dunlop QC, one of Scotland’s leading lawyers, who was the government’s external counsel, had been furious that government officials failed to disclose critical evidence about the prior contact of the investigating officer with the two complainants.

Sturgeon said that, as she had stated in her evidence on Wednesday, there was “no question” that the case should be dropped until this new evidence emerged, and that the government was acting in accordance with the views of the law officers at the time.

03:37 Nicola Sturgeon: no plot against Alex Salmond – video

She said: “I answered questions for eight hours yesterday, I answered every question that was put to me and I intend to rest on that to allow both the committee and the inquiry into the ministerial code to conclude their work.”

In addition to the Holyrood committee’s inquiry, there is a separate independent investigation by James Hamilton, former director of public prosecutions for Ireland, into whether Sturgeon broke the ministerial code by misleading parliament over meetings with Salmond to discuss the allegations.

t Davidson said MSPs had “every right to question a first minister who is the head of a government that failed these two women”.

“I want everyone to understand how incompetent and secretive this government is,” she said, adding: “Because of legal advice that had to be dragged from this government under the threat of a vote of no confidence, we know that for weeks this government were definitively, without any doubt, ignoring legal advice.”

After Davidson accused her of breaking the ministerial code, Sturgeon hit back that the Tory MSP had “just shown her true colours all over again”.

“Just as on Tuesday night the Conservatives prejudged my evidence to the parliamentary inquiry, she’s just prejudged the outcome of the independent inquiry into the ministerial code. This is just about desperate political games for the Conservatives.”

The newly elected Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, said the exchanges between Sturgeon and Davidson “represent the worst of our politics”, but went on to press the first minister on the same subject, asking why it took the threat of a no-confidence vote for the government to act.

Sturgeon said: “I think it is now right and proper that we now allow the inquiry to do its work, allow the independent inquiry into the ministerial code to do its work, and we allow me to get on with the job I believe the majority of the country want me to focus on now, which is to continue to steer this country through a global pandemic so that we can through Covid, come out of lockdown and get back to normality.”","['nicola', 'legal', 'sturgeon', 'code', 'vote', 'scottish', 'allow', 'accuses', 'prejudging', 'opposition', 'outcome', 'evidence', 'inquiries', 'davidson', 'ministerial', 'inquiry']"
5,['Tom Phillips'],"The mayor of Rio de Janeiro has ordered a coronavirus “curfew” in the hope of sparing the seaside city a repeat of last year’s Covid-19 “genocide” when it was pummeled by the disease.

The nighttime prohibition, which Mayor Eduardo Paes said would last from 11pm to 5am, was announced as hospitals across Brazil buckled under the strain of a crippling upsurge in infections and the South American country suffered its worst day of losses since the pandemic began.

In an open letter, Brazilian scientists urged the federal government to declare an immediate 14-day lockdown, claiming that was now the only way to avert a catastrophe of “despair and deaths”.

“The country can no longer afford to wait,” the Observatório Covid-19 BR group warned, blaming the surge in infection on the collapse of social distancing, government inaction and the spread of the new, apparently more infectious P1 variant linked to the Amazon city of Manaus.

Such restrictions appear inconceivable under Jair Bolsonaro, the president and a Trump-admiring former paratrooper whose handling of the epidemic has been internationally condemned, earning him the nickname “Captain Corona”.

“If it’s up to me, there will be no lockdown,” the far-right populist declared on Wednesday as a record 1,840 fatalities took Brazil’s official death toll to nearly 260,000.

Brazil’s former health minister, José Gomes Temporão, said his country had suffered a complete leadership blackout at the moment it most needed direction.

“The truth is that our state governors and mayors have been abandoned to their own fates,” Temporão said, denouncing what he called Bolsonaro’s “criminal approach” to Covid-19.

“This isn’t just about omission or disorganization or incompetence,” Temporão added, highlighting Bolsonaro’s incessant undermining of containment measures, failure to acquire sufficient vaccines and anti-scientific promotion of unproven remedies such as hydroxychloroquine.

“We are talking about a determined, repeated, sustained, dogged stance which has made a point of destroying of all the country’s capabilities to fight the pandemic.”

Mayor Paes said Rio’s restrictions, which come into force on Friday and will initially last a week, were designed to avoid a repeat of “the genocide that Rio saw in 2020”. Shops, restaurants and bars will have to shut at 5pm while nightclubs, street markets and music venues must close. Samba parties are also outlawed.

“[Last year] twice as many people died in Rio as in São Paulo, which has twice the population. The goal is to stop this happening again in 2021,” Paes told reporters.

Critics say the measures are woefully inadequate. So far, Rio’s hospitals remain in better shape than in cities such as Porto Alegre, Salvador and São Paulo, where some intensive care units have completely run out of beds. But local doctors are bracing for a similar explosion in patients. “We’re preparing to get well and truly shafted,” one frontline doctor told the Guardian by text message.

Temporão said Brazil’s “prolonged agony” – which comes as some neighbours, such as Argentina, begin cautiously reopening – was in large measure the fault of one man.

“Today in Brazil we’re facing a political crisis, an extremely serious economic crisis, a social crisis, a public health crisis and an ethical crisis.

“Brazil is learning in a very harsh and sad way the price that a society pays for having a government that is utterly disconnected and oblivious to the fortunes of its fellow citizens,” he said.","['country', 'rio', 'mayor', 'curfew', 'crisis', 'imposes', 'covid', 'temporão', 'suffered', 'way', 'genocide', 'told', 'são', 'avert', 'repeat', 'twice', 'paes']"
6,['Laura Snapes'],"Ian Brown has pulled out of headlining the Neighbourhood Weekender festival in Warrington this September after claiming that all attendees require proof of vaccination.

Brown is a noted Covid sceptic, frequently using his Twitter account to spread disinformation about the virus and protections against it. “I refuse to accept vaccination proof as condition of entry,” he tweeted yesterday.

Promoter SJM Concerts said that it would “comply with the conditions outlined by the government through the local authority. No decisions will be taken by government until 21 June at the earliest.”

Brown previously appealed to festival promoters on Twitter asking them not to work with Sage and the government on vaccine passports, describing the situation as “the new nazi normal”.

Festival organisers recently told the Guardian that social distancing would be impossible at large-scale events. They would comply with suggested measures, whether rapid testing or vaccine passports.

The government has wavered on whether it will enforce vaccine passports. The vaccine minister, Nadhim Zahawi, called them “discriminatory”, but foreign secretary Dominic Raab has said that they are “under consideration”.

UK festivals have reported a sales spike since the government announced the roadmap out of lockdown last week, but organisers remain concerned about the possibility of last-minute cancellations owing to resurgences of the virus, particularly in the absence of a government-backed insurance scheme for live music events.

The government has been resistant to providing such a scheme. The spring budget added £300m investment to the £1.57bn culture recovery fund and saw the extension of the £500m insurance scheme protecting film and TV productions in the UK against the cost of Covid shutdowns until the end of the year.","['ian', 'festival', 'organisers', 'music', 'pulls', 'covid', 'passports', 'scheme', 'vaccination', 'row', 'virus', 'vaccine', 'twitter', 'insurance', 'brown', 'proof']"
7,['Robert Booth'],"Some care homes are planning to defy government demands to let relatives hold their loved ones’ hands on indoor visits from Monday as they say the risk of transmitting Covid-19 remains too high.

Following pressure from relatives and charities including Age UK, the government has told care operators to make physical contact possible from the start of next week using testing and PPE. But some have warned relatives they will not allow it.

Some have said they must wait until local directors of public health say it is safe, and some have postponed in-person visits altogether. Others have said no visits will happen until all residents have had their second dose of vaccine, according to the Relatives and Residents Association (RRA) and the Rights for Residents campaign.

Diane Mayhew, a co-founder of Rights for Residents, said one supporter had been told visits would not happen because they were “at the manager’s discretion”.

Helen Wildbore, the RRA’s director, said: “Lot’s of people won’t have had a meaningful visit since the first lockdown, and many families have stopped window visits because they are too distressing. In the last 24 hours we heard of one relative who has been told by their loved one’s care home that visits won’t go ahead until they have seen the guidance. They have been through a lot already so this is incredibly disappointing.”

Relatives’ groups had lobbied for an urgent restart to in-person visits to care homes allowing physical contact, with some families separated for months and reports of severe deterioration of isolated residents.

Guidance for the visits issued on Thursday states “there should not be close physical contact such as hugging” but says “risks [of transmission] can be managed and mitigated, and they should be balanced against the importance of visiting and the benefits it brings to care home residents and their families”. It says all care homes where there is no outbreak should seek to enable indoor visits.

This week relatives of residents at Pelham House, a care home in Folkestone, Kent, that lost half of its 20 residents to Covid in the first wave, were told visits would not go ahead.

The home said in a letter: “We feel that we need to postpone these visits until such a time that we feel they can be conducted in a way that poses the least possible risk to all our residents, staff and their families.”

The move disappointed some relatives. Suzanne Amos said she had not seen her mother for three months, and as her mother has a terminal illness caused by dementia she wanted to see her while her mother still recognised her.

“It’s exactly at this time that mum still recognises me that I want to make the most of the fact and go and visit,” she said. “For someone with dementia you need to be in the room with them or it is too confusing for them.”

Barchester, one of the largest care home operators with around 230 facilities, has asked the government to postpone the visiting plan, warning that lateral flow tests for visitors lack accuracy.

“If the government doesn’t respond to our request to delay the visiting for a few weeks, only until everyone’s had their second jab and the levels of virus are lower, then we will comply, but we have written to all of our relatives,” said Pete Calveley, the chain’s chief executive.

The guidance says vaccination is not a condition of visiting but is strongly recommended. From 12 April, two visitors could be allowed per person.

Last month as part of efforts to lift lockdown in stages in England, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said that from 8 March all care home residents could be visited indoors by a single named individual, who would be allowed to make repeat visits.

Visitors will be required to have a test beforehand and to wear PPE during the visit. They will also be included in the regular PCR testing that care home staff receive. However, they will be “asked to avoid” closer contact than hand-holding, including hugging and kissing. The scheme has been designed with the involvement of England’s deputy chief medical officers and Public Health England.

Outbreaks in care homes fell to 157 in the last week of February, down from 692 in the first week of 2021. But anxiety about visitors reseeding infection amid loosening of some lockdown measures next week, including the reopening of schools, is running high among care home operators, who have seen more than 40,000 Covid-19 deaths across the UK.

“Providers have had such an awful time around this,” said Nadra Ahmed, the executive director of the National Care Forum. “There is nervousness.”","['care', 'week', 'homes', 'handholding', 'english', 'delay', 'told', 'visitors', 'residents', 'visits', 'allowing', 'relatives', 'visiting', 'contact']"
8,['Daniel Boffey'],"Europeans need to “get back to basics” and use quarantining to battle the rise in infection rates that has emerged in half the region over the last week, according to the World Health Organization.

Hans Kluge, the WHO’s director for Europe, said the latest data showed a 9% rise in new cases of Covid-19, in what would be a worrying development for overstrained health services across the continent.

While noting that vaccination programmes were already reducing transmission and hospitalisation, it would “take time” for the strategy to come to full fruition, he said.

Vaccinations have begun in 45 countries in the European region, according to the WHO. But the level of coverage remains low even among the 27 member states of the EU, where just 7% of the population has received a jab.

Kluge said: “Last week new cases of Covid-19 in Europe rose 9% to just above a million. This brought a promising six-week decline in new cases to an end, with more than half of our region seeing increasing numbers of new infections.

“We are seeing a resurgence in central and eastern Europe. New cases are also on the rise in several western European countries, where rates were already high.

“Continued strain on our hospitals and health workers is being met with acts of medical solidarity between European neighbours. Nonetheless, over a year into the pandemic our health systems should not be in this situation. We need to get back to the basics.”

Kluge said governments needed to invest more in the sequencing that could identify variants of coronavirus, and improve their testing, tracing and quarantine systems.

He also called on governments to do what they could to avoid “pandemic fatigue” leading to a breakdown in social distancing.

The coronavirus variant initially identified in the UK had been reported in 43 of 53 countries in the European region within Kluge’s remit, while the South African variant had been found in 26. The variant identified in Brazil and Japan had been discovered in 15 European countries.

Kluge said: “We need to suppress the spread of the virus everywhere, using what we know works. Vaccination is already saving lives, with hospitalisation and deaths in most at-risk groups declining significantly, but vaccinating every population group will take time.”

On Thursday Slovakia transferred its first coronavirus patients abroad, to Poland, as the country’s hospitals became full with patients amid a resurgent pandemic.

Slovakia has reported the world’s highest number of Covid-related deaths per capita over the past week, as the government’s restrictions have failed so far to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

9,['Caroline Davies'],"It is one brief clip, just 30 seconds long. But what the latest trailer for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s highly anticipated interview with Oprah Winfrey hints at is there will be no holding back.

Meghan’s statement, that she and Harry could not be expected to stay silent if “the firm” is playing an active role in “perpetuating falsehoods” about them, appears on the face of it to be extraordinary.

“The firm” has long been shorthand for the royal family, ever since Prince Philip is said to have coined it on his marriage to Princess Elizabeth. It was used by Diana, Princess of Wales, and often not in a complimentary way.

Over the years it has acquired more negative connotations, perhaps more than Philip could have foreseen, conjuring a juggernaut of monarchy, resisting interference and obstacle.

It has been used to describe core members of the royal family. Equally, it has been used to encapsulate the wider institution of senior households and the men, and women, “in grey suits” that Meghan appears to have come to intensely dislike.

Context is everything. It remains to be seen whether Meghan is directing her ire in the teaser at the Queen, Charles, or William or at their courtiers. Buckingham Palace will discover, along with the rest of the world, only when the interview is finally aired.

If it is among the former, it surely raises the question if the couple’s already strained relationship with other members of the royal family, is now simply unsalvageable.

Those close to the couple say they do not have individual senior royals in their crosshairs. One said whenever Meghan, in private, discussed such issues, it had never been directed at individual members of the family.

It is said that she and Harry both tend to use the phrase “the firm” as interchangeable with the broader institution, the royal households and the courtiers who run the royal family’s operations.

What is now clear, though, is this interview will be wide-ranging. On the agenda will certainly be the couple’s condemnation of a “toxic” British press.

The toll, the pressure of royal life on the couple, is reflected in Winfrey’s question: “… ‘almost unsurvivable’ sounds like there was a breaking point?”

Winfrey’s comments: “Were you silent or were you silenced?” and “You’ve said some pretty shocking things here”, are all designed to whet the appetite.

Harry speaks of “history repeating itself”. Certainly, that is a feeling Buckingham Palace will share, about 25 years after his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, unburdened herself to Martin Bashir in the Panorama interview which hastened her divorce from Prince Charles.

The timing and subject of this latest trailer capitalise on the controversy surrounding allegations published in the Times of bullying by Meghan, and denied by her through her lawyers, of staff who worked for her at Kensington Palace.

Sources say the Sussexes had no control over either the clip released, or the timing of it, which was all down to CBS. In fact, the couple’s interview was filmed before those allegations were made public, designed, according to the Sussexes’ lawyers, as a smear campaign against them.

Buckingham Palace’s mantra of “never complain, never explain” may have served well in the past, but clearly would not be appropriate in this case.

The unprecedented inquiry the palace has announced into these allegations – the first such inquiry into senior member of the royal family – has not de-escalated the rising tensions leading up to Sunday’s broadcast.

The trend for oversize silhouettes and loose layers has united fashion fans, religious and secular, and has been in part an attempt by western brands to buy into the lucrative market of Muslim consumers. This shift has also seen the headscarf become increasingly acceptable, even covetable, in western fashion, with Nike, Uniqlo, Liberty, Tommy Hilfiger and Dolce & Gabbana among the brands selling scarves overtly tailored for use as hijabs in recent years.

Islamic dress, however, remains a lightning rod for controversy. Hijab bans are continually discussed in France while Switzerland is to hold a referendum on burqas this week, even as governments around the world encourage the use of face masks. China, too, has persecuted women for wearing the hijab.

In fashion, nothing has illustrated the tension as clearly as the story of Halima Aden, the trailblazing hijab-wearing Muslim model who was celebrated as an icon of inclusivity when she made her debut at Kanye West’s New York fashion week show in 2017, then walked for Alberta Ferretti and Maxmara in Milan.

Aden appeared on magazine covers, including British Vogue, and won major commercial contracts. Carine Roitfeld described her as “a different beauty” saying she was “drawn to her instantly”. Her inclusion was a win-win for the western fashion industry, which slapped itself on the back for doing a service to diversity, while also attracting a profitable new audience.

But two months ago, Aden announced that she was quitting the fashion industry because she felt the work had compromised her religious beliefs – particularly those concerning the hijab. In a series of emotional posts to her 1.4m followers on Instagram Stories, she showed a range of pictures of the way she was styled, with hats and various accessories used to meet the technical requirements of covering her hair (on one occasion, this included pairs of jeans) and said that she had felt deeply unhappy about them. She contrasted these images with photographs wearing coverings she was comfortable in, which covered her ears, neck, shoulders and chest. “Looking back now I did what I said I would never do,” she wrote, “which is compromise who I am in order to fit in.”

Aden’s high-profile declaration magnified deeper issues within the “modest fashion” concept and sent shock waves through the world of Muslim influencers and models, for whom she had become a kind of unofficial figurehead. “Halima’s words caused a huge ripple in our community. Everyone was talking about it,” says influencer Sebina Hussain, an influencer also known online as Sebinaah, who works with brands including Viktor & Rolf and Swarovski.

“For as long as I can remember, the media has portrayed women in hijab as oppressed. That is until modest fashion came along and the conversation for some-part has shifted,” says Hussain. This shift has, according to Hussain, left those adopting a less commercial look behind. “I’ve experienced it first-hand, how differently people treat me when I go out in an Abaya and no makeup versus an outfit from the high street and a face full of makeup.”

In her work as an influencer, she has had to speak out when concepts do not align with her values. “Many times I’ve worried I am being a nuisance and the brand may not want to work with me again”. Although, so far, her clients have always taken her concerns on board, this ties into “a huge pressure on Muslim women to look more western in any situation. The pressure is to want to appear more ‘normal’, to wipe away this negative stereotype associated with women in hijab,” she says.

Aden, too, said she felt this pressure. In her case, as a 19-year-old newcomer to the fashion industry, she said she felt “too scared to speak up” on photoshoots. She noted being called “frumpy” when opting for a more traditional hijab and said she felt pressure to look more “sexy”. She asserted that the fashion industry – with its paucity of Muslim stylists – didn’t understand the hijab within a religious, rather than aesthetic, context.

Aden’s presentation, in the fashion industry, was reminiscent of “hijabi” streetstyle – a glossy trend-led look popular on social media, in which headscarves were worn but clothes were not always noticeably ‘modest’. The popularity of this look – much copied among the army of teenage girls who look to social media for tips on wearing the hijab – seems to have helped muddy mainstream fashion’s understanding of what a hijab actually is.

The model Mariah Idrissi shot to fame in a campaign for the high-street chain H&M in 2015 – in which she wore a printed headscarf (which looks very similar to a traditional keffiyeh) and a loose salmon-pink coat over a monochrome ensemble.

She points out that many successful modest influencers have started dressing in an increasingly westernised way in recent years, which to her, gives the mainstream fashion industry the impression that these successful, high-profile women reflect the way all “fashionable” Muslim women may want to dress.

“The mainstream continue to look at them like figureheads for that community,” she says, “but they may not represent that any more.” She says the popularity of the commercially friendly “hijabi streetstyle” has a ripple effect “if others are adjusting their hijab – my way of dressing may have started to feel more extreme”.

Reina Lewis, professor of cultural studies at London College of Fashion says religious cultures are very often relegated to ‘aesthetic inspiration’”. Lewis, who recently co-authored two reports looking at modest workwear, points to more diverse recruitment as an “urgent need”. Citing Aden as a prime example of an employee presenting a greater need for “religious fashion literacy”.

“The lack of experience managing religious diversity in a professional team structured her experiences – here’s a model who was able to negotiate that she would never appear without her covering her hair but it proved insufficient in a context where brands and fashion professionals didn’t know enough about what covering means,” says Lewis. “Employers and the fashion industry need to learn the language of modest fashion.”

Until then, as Aden’s story has shown, the space that fashion has created so far for the hijab has been one in its own image: confined, reductive and limited.","['pressure', 'modest', 'appear', 'western', 'crisis', 'normal', 'fashion', 'hijab', 'look', 'religious', 'muslim', 'felt', 'women', 'industry']"
11,['Marie Le Conte'],"“I’m sure this budget will look better on Instagram,” said Keir Starmer in the Commons on Wednesday. “In fact, this week’s PR video cost the taxpayer so much, I was half expecting to see a line in the OBR forecast for it.”

Budget 2021 live: Sunak holds briefing after flagging tax rises to pay for Covid recovery Read more

The quip was aimed at Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, and someone who has become increasingly hard to avoid online. The video in question was nearly six minutes long, and featured about a hundred different shots of the 40-year-old talking about the year he has had at the Treasury.

With its moments of stylish lens flare and rousing orchestral soundtrack, it was a jarring watch, mostly because it felt like promotional content for a social media influencer, not the chancellor.

It didn’t come out of nowhere; since getting promoted by Johnson, Sunak’s social media feeds have been full of slick graphics, complete with his trademark signature. Over on Instagram, there are countless snazzy and stylish slogans, as well as pictures of the man himself looking professional yet relaxed, wearing hoodies and making light jokes in the captions.

Scroll back a bit further, however, and the real Rishi begins to come out. Back in 2019, Sunak’s feed looked exactly like what you would expect from an MP. There were slightly awkward pictures in small businesses – complete with unnecessary flash – and grainy, blurry pictures of him at the Proms, looking like someone who’d won a Blue Peter competition to be there.

The man behind the glow-up was Cass Horowitz, a special adviser and co-founder of The Clerkenwell Brothers, an “independent creative studio working across strategy, identity, advertising & social”. Looking at the company’s stylised photoshoots of fancy ice-cream, luxury tequila and pouty women posing with green juice provides much needed context for the chancellor’s transformation. After all, a politician can be a product like any other; you just need to know how to market it.

“There’s a certain obvious opportunism to it,” says Philip Seargeant, author of The Art of Political Storytelling. “The particular approach he and his team are taking is probably a lot to do with the old advertising idea of positioning – finding a distinct persona within the market – so the slick but homely image that’s being pushed for him is different from the belligerent populist images that have dominated politics recently, and has the chance to stand out because of this.”

Still, the real question is: who is Brand Rishi being marketed to? This was raised by Henry Hill, the news editor of Conservative Home: “Given that the prime minister seems fairly secure in post and we’re three years away from a general election, why is he investing so much in building up his brand with the country at large? The only electorate he’s likely to face any time soon is his Richmond [Yorkshire] constituency, who would return anyone with a blue rosette.”

It isn’t even clear that the general public is the target. Take the budget video; on Twitter, which is heavily populated with Westminster insiders and political obsessives, it was watched more than 850,000 times. On Facebook, where politicians usually go to connect with more normal voters, the figure is only 33,000. Either by mistake or design, Dishy Rishi is largely being sold to the SW1 bubble, to whom a case doesn’t necessarily need to be made. This may well end up having some unintended consequences.

“The principle of collective government is supposed to be that all policies are signed off by the cabinet and the prime minister, and therefore they’re the government’s policies,” says Hill. “When he was announcing lots of very popular stuff and having his signature and his branding on it rather than the Conservative party branding, that was rubbing some people up the wrong way.”

Choosing to put himself in the spotlight this early on is risky; stars cannot keep rising forever and, especially in the fickle world of politics, it doesn’t take much to become yesterday’s man. It also seems worth mentioning that his strategy is a novel one; although many MPs have relatively high-profile social media accounts, none have pushed it quite as far as he has.

“I don’t think we’ve seen anything on this scale before,” says Bethany Wheatley, the former head of digital of the Conservative party. “Cameron had Web Cameron and strategists who understood digital, so there was a cohesiveness, but his policies were not tied to his name as the brand in the same way.”

Until Brand Rishi came along, power-hungry politicians had to raise their profile through others. There were long sit-down interviews with friendly journalists who would wax lyrical about their impeccable homes and lovely children, or soft-focus conversations on television shows not known for their hard-hitting questions.

Then, within Westminster, it was about building a fresh and trustworthy team of people around you who could talk you up to hacks and MPs alike. The game was really about surrounding yourself with people who happened to find you remarkable, instead of having to remind everyone yourself of how remarkable you were.

Cutting out the middleman may feel like a quicker option, but Sunak should keep something in mind: shortcuts tend to remain shortcuts for a reason. Everyone would take them otherwise.","['media', 'man', 'influence', 'looking', 'video', 'brand', 'le', 'rishi', 'turned', 'pictures', 'policies', 'star', 'sunak', 'marie', 'social', 'trying']"
12,['Derecka Purnell'],"On Wednesday night, the House of Representatives voted to pass the George Floyd Act, named after the Black man killed by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin last summer. Among many reforms, the act seeks to ban racial profiling, overhaul qualified immunity for police, and ban the use of chokeholds. While these seem like good measures, they are woefully insufficient to stop police violence. These reforms could not have even saved George Floyd’s life.

To be clear, Floyd did not die from a chokehold. A police officer put his knee to Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. A medical examiner’s autopsy reported “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression”. Floyd also had blunt force trauma to his head, face and shoulders. Banning chokeholds is important, as we should reduce the number of tactics that the police can employ to be dangerous. However, the problem with policing is precisely that – they can kill people using a diverse number of tactics. Shooting, kneeling, punching, suffocating, Tasing. Congress banned one practice, and not even the one responsible for the homicide.

Floyd was also probably not racially profiled. He did not have to be if he was breaking the law. Reportedly, Floyd tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store. The clerk called the police because using counterfeit money is illegal. The definition of racial profiling is when police uses someone’s race to suspect that they have committed a crime. Here, Floyd’s act may have constituted a crime and the police showed up to fix it. What’s more criminal than counterfeit cash is the society where people live off of these transactions in corner stores in the first place. The police cannot solve this problem. They can show up and attempt to stop the crime, but they can’t stop the underlying conditions that give rise to it: class exploitation and poverty. Floyd appeared to need cash, not the police.

Congress has had several opportunities to give people what they actually need under the pandemic: money. By the time of Floyd’s death, lawmakers had only distributed $2,000 to the public, and not everyone received this stimulus check. I wonder if Floyd would have used a counterfeit $20 if Congress would have issued $2,000 a month to the public as several activists and progressive legislators have been demanding. George Floyd’s blood is on their hands.

But instead, Congress does what it always does when the police kill people: give cops more money. The George Floyd Act, named after someone who died because he didn’t have money to cover cigarettes, gives millions of dollars to police in grants. And lawmakers gave the police more money right after they failed to secure a $15 federal minimum wage and failed to deliver on the $2,000 checks they promised to voters who put Democrats in office. But, Congress made sure to include $750m in the George Floyd Act to investigate the deadly use of force by law enforcement. Protesters have been demanding to defund the police to keep us safe; not spend millions of dollars to investigate how we die. We know how we die – the police.

The Democratic party has repeatedly said “Black Lives Matter” since the Ferguson uprising in 2014. The Democratic national convention featured images and families involved in racial justice protests. Yet the party has mostly downright ignored the largest network of Black-led organizations, the Movement for Black Lives, who have been demanding that lawmakers pass The Breathe Act, the most comprehensive criminal legal package in the history of the United States. Representatives Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib announced the legislation last summer. The Breathe Act invests resources in all communities to alleviate police violence by building sustainable neighborhoods and reducing contact with law enforcement. The Act calls for investments in gainful employment, quality housing, and pilots for universal basic income. But Congress would rather pay for police than give resources to the masses of people suffering police violence.

And under the George Floyd Act, police will still kill more than 1,000 people every year. The victims will be overwhelmingly poor, Black, and disabled.

I completely understand that the political climate might require some compromises on the bill text. Top Democrats will hide behind these arguments to suggest that they will not find support for more progressive legislation. But political will starts with them to plant the seeds among their colleagues to make this possible. They cannot use their Republican colleagues as a shield from criticism when it is actually them, Democrats, who are not committed to more transformational policies. Vice-President Kamala Harris could have overruled the Senate parliamentarian who decided to remove the $15 minimum wage from the new Covid-19 relief package; she did not. The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, could have stood up and championed The Breathe Act; she kneeled for a photo opportunity wearing Kente cloth instead. And Joe Biden could have kept his promise for $2,000 checks for people facing evictions, hunger and unemployment; he and the first lady put giant hearts on the White House lawn for Valentine’s Day instead.

14,[],"A severe 7.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the east of New Zealand’s North Island on Friday, prompting a tsunami warning and calls for people in coastal areas to move immediately to high ground.

Tsunami waves were possible within 300km (200 miles) of the quake’s epicentre, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) said.

There were no immediate reports of serious damage or casualties, but the New Zealand National Emergency Management Agency warned of a tsunami threat along the east of North Island.

“Anyone near the coast who felt a LONG or STRONG quake should MOVE IMMEDIATELY to the nearest high ground, or as far inland as you can,” the agency said in a tweet.

The New Zealand government’s seismic monitor Geonet assessed the quake at a magnitude of 7.2 with a depth of 94km (58 miles).

More than 60,000 people reported feeling the quake on GeoNet’s website, with 282 people describing the shaking as “severe” and 75 saying it was “extreme”. Most others described it as light.

The US Geological Survey initially recorded the quake at 7.3, then revised it down to 6.9. It said the quake occurred at a depth of 10km.

15,['Alison Flood'],"US customers have flocked to buy copies of Dr Seuss titles after six of the children’s author’s books were withdrawn because of racist portrayals of people of colour.

Dr Seuss Enterprises, which preserves the late Theodor Seuss Geisel’s legacy, announced on Tuesday – the author’s birthday – that after working with a panel of experts to review Seuss’s books, it had concluded that the six titles portrayed people in ways that were “hurtful and wrong”.

Seuss’s first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, contains an illustration of a Chinese man that caused controversy two years ago when it was included in a mural. If I Ran the Zoo suggests a “chieftain” in a turban could be kept in a zoo, and contains a drawing of two men, described as being from Africa, wearing grass skirts and carrying exotic-looking animals.

“Ceasing sales of these books is only part of our commitment and our broader plan to ensure Dr Seuss Enterprises’ catalogue represents and supports all communities and families,” said the organisation on Tuesday. Conservative media reacted to the news with outrage. Fox News declared: “cancel culture strikes beloved author” and that “if we lose this battle, America is lost”.

On Thursday morning, Amazon.com’s bestseller chart was filled with Seuss titles. Nine of the Top 10 books were by the late writer, and 30 of the Top 50. Used copies of the six titles for which publication has now ceased – And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, If I Ran the Zoo, McElligot’s Pool, On Beyond Zebra, Scrambled Eggs Super! and The Cat’s Quizzer – were put on sale for hundreds of dollars, as sellers looked to profit from the decision.

“I can’t tell you how angry I am that it will no longer be published!!” wrote one Amazon reviewer on the listing for Mulberry Street, while another ruled that there was “no racism here. Just overly PC people actively looking for something to be offended about.”

Seuss himself later revised the 1937 title Mulberry Street, saying that: “I had a gentleman with a pigtail. I colored him yellow and called him a Chinaman. That’s the way thing were 50 years ago. In later editions I refer to him as a Chinese man. I have taken the color out of the gentleman and removed the pigtail and now he looks like an Irishman.”

Seuss died in 1991, and more than 600m copies of his books are in circulation, earning Dr Seuss Enterprises about $33m (£24m) before tax in 2020, up from $9.5m in 2015, according to the company.

16,['Rob Davies'],"The White House has agreed to drop retaliatory US tariffs on UK exports including scotch whisky, raising hopes of a post-Brexit transatlantic trade deal.

In 2019, the then US president, Donald Trump, imposed a 25% tariff on a range of European Union exports, as part of a 16-year trade dispute over state support for aerospace rivals Boeing and Airbus.

Estimates released last month suggested the duty had led to a £500m dropoff in sales of Scottish single malt alone.

But the Department for International Trade (DIT) said on Thursday the Biden administration had ended the tariff. The move followed the UK scrapping punitive measures against Boeing in January.

“The easier it is for Americans to buy a bottle of Macallan, Talisker or Glenfiddich, the more money those producers will have to invest in their businesses, their staff and futures,” said the trade minister Liz Truss. “Today’s agreement shows that both the UK and the US are determined to work together to build back better and take our trading relationship to new heights.”

The rapprochement, which was first reported by the Spectator, will also result in tariffs being lifted on a range of goods, including £11m of cashmere, £38m of pork products and £45m of cheese, the DIT said.

“From scotch whisky distillers to stilton-makers, businesses across the UK will benefit from the US decision today to suspend tariffs in this dispute,” said Boris Johnson.

The government said it would continue to seek a “fair settlement” with the White House that removed all remaining punitive tariffs related to the dispute to boost the UK’s aerospace industry.

“The government reserves the right to reimpose tariffs at any point if satisfactory progress towards an agreeable settlement is not made,” the DIT said.

The move puts the UK at odds with the EU, which imposed retaliatory tariffs on US imports worth $4bn (£3bn) after the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled the US had given illegal state aid to Boeing. The dispute stretches back to 2006, when the US complained that Airbus was receiving subsidies that put Boeing at a competitive disadvantage.

Drinks industry figures welcomed an end to tariffs that have proved a drag on sales.

“Today is a very good day for Scotch and Scotland,” said Ivan Menezes, the chief executive of Diageo, which owns brands including Johnnie Walker and Talisker. “Final resolution of the aerospace dispute, combined with the announcement of a continued freeze on spirits duty in yesterday’s Budget, will safeguard thousands of jobs across Scotland and the UK.”","['uk', 'scotch', 'dispute', 'white', 'dit', 'aerospace', 'exports', 'drop', 'tariffs', 'whisky', 'including', 'boeing', 'trade']"
17,[],"A female doctor has been killed in a bomb blast in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad in what appeared to be another targeted attack, days after three female media workers were shot dead in the area.

Journalists, religious scholars, activists and judges have been victims of a recent wave of political killings across Afghanistan, forcing many into hiding, with some fleeing the country.

In the latest incident, the doctor was killed after a magnetic bomb was attached to the vehicle in which she was travelling, according to a spokesperson for the provincial governor’s office. A child was also injured by the explosion.

“She was commuting in a rickshaw when the bomb went off,” the spokesperson said.

The blast was claimed by the local affiliate of Islamic State, according to the Site Intelligence Group. The jihadist group reportedly said the victim had been “working as an apostate Afghan intelligence element”.

On Tuesday three female media workers were shot dead in Jalalabad in separate attacks minutes apart. Those attacks were also claimed by Isis.

Afghan and US officials have previously blamed the Taliban for the wave of violence, but the group has repeatedly denied the charges.

The killings have been acutely felt by women, whose rights were crushed under the Taliban’s five-year rule, including being banned from working. Intelligence officials have previously linked the renewed threat against female professionals to demands at peace talks for their rights to be protected.

The attacks come as speculation is rife over the US’s future in Afghanistan after the Biden administration announced plans to review the withdrawal agreement signed with the Taliban last year that paved the way for foreign troops to leave the country by May.","['bomb', 'afghanistan', 'spokesperson', 'targeted', 'group', 'attacks', 'workers', 'female', 'killed', 'working', 'taliban', 'doctor', 'intelligence', 'wave', 'attack']"
18,['Linda Geddes'],"Four scientists who discovered a key mechanism that causes migraines, paving the way for new preventive treatments, have won the largest prize for neuroscience in the world, sharing £1.1m.

The Lundbeck Foundation in Denmark announced on Thursday that the British researcher Peter Goadsby, Michael Moskowitz of the US, Lars Edvinsson of Sweden and Jes Olesen of Denmark had won the Brain prize.

Speaking at a press briefing ahead of the announcement, Goadsby, a professor of neurology at King’s College London, said: “I’m excited that migraine research is getting this award and that migraine – this disabling problem that is a brain disorder – is being recognised in an appropriate way.”

Formally known as the Grete Lundbeck European brain research prize, the annual award recognises highly original and influential advances in any area of brain research. The award ceremony will take place in Copenhagen on 25 October, where the prize will be presented by Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark.

The prize-winning research revolves around unpicking the neural basis of migraine, a crippling neurological condition characterised by episodes of throbbing head pain, as well as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, extreme sensitivity to sound, light, touch and smell. It affects about one in seven people globally and is about three times more common in women than men. In the UK, it is estimated that migraines result in the loss of 25m work or school days each year at an economic cost of £2.3bn.

For many years, migraine was thought to be a psychosomatic condition, resulting from people being unable to deal with stress. Although treatments were available, these only helped to relieve the symptoms, rather than addressing the root cause, which was unknown.

In 1979, Moskowitz, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, proposed that migraines result from an interaction between the trigeminal nerve – involved in detecting sensations from the head and face – and the thin, pain-sensitive “meninges” membranes that surround the brain. He demonstrated that migraine attacks were triggered when trigeminal nerve fibres released chemicals called neuropeptides that caused the blood vessels of the meninges to dilate, resulting in inflammation and pain. He suggested that blocking the action of these neuropeptides could provide a new type of treatment.

Another breakthrough came when Goadsby, together with Edvinsson, a professor of internal medicine at Lund University in Sweden and the president of the International Headache Society, identified the key neuropeptide involved in triggering these attacks: calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).

Further work by Olesen showed that when CGRP was given to migraine patients it could trigger an attack, and that drugs that blocked the neuropeptide could help treat migraine. In 2004, he and his team published the results of a large clinical trial suggesting that such “CGRP antagonist drugs” were effective in the acute treatment of migraine attacks.

This has led to the development of new treatments, including monoclonal antibody-based drugs such as erenumab, currently available in the UK, and the small molecule drugs rimegepant and ubrogepant, which are as yet only available in the US. Although these drugs do not cure migraine, they markedly improve the quality of life of many patients, helping to both treat and prevent migraine attacks.

Goadsby said: “I think the important thing about this research is that it shows a neuroscience-based approach has value and that bench and bedside research married together has the ability to change clinical practice. I’m humbled by the emails that we get from patients whose lives have been changed by these medicines. We haven’t changed them all, we’ve only just started, but what this research shows is that migraine is a tractable problem.”","['goadsby', 'win', 'treatments', 'discovered', 'prize', '11m', 'migraines', 'scientists', 'migraine', 'patients', 'professor', 'mechanism', 'research', 'brain', 'drugs']"
19,['Alex Kotch'],"Republican senators cited a study commissioned by the biggest oil and gas trade association in the US in their criticisms of Deb Haaland, Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Department of the Interior, during a confirmation hearing last week.

Republicans on the Senate energy and natural resources committee referenced the study, which has been widely criticized by conservationists, as they grilled Haaland, a Democratic US representative from New Mexico, on her past statements about energy issues and the Biden administration’s climate plans.

At issue in particular was the administration’s 60-day pause on new federal oil and gas leases, which several senators mischaracterized as a “ban”.

All Republicans on the committee have received significant campaign contributions from oil and gas political action committees and employees, and some are personally invested in the industry, as the Guardian and the Center for Media and Democracy recently reported.

Haaland, who would be the first Native American cabinet secretary, supports the Green New Deal and opposes fracking on federal land. As secretary of the interior, she would implement Biden’s climate agenda, which, though relatively ambitious, may not go as far as she would prefer.

As they criticized Haaland and Biden’s stance on federal leases, two of the senators cited projected job losses from a ban on federal oil and gas extraction that came from a study commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute (API). API is the country’s biggest oil and gas trade association and spent millions of dollars to help elect Republicans to Congress in the 2020 cycle.

John Barrasso of Wyoming, the ranking member on the committee and a top Senate recipient of oil and gas contributions, cited the institute’s September 2020 study three times during the hearings, and Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi referenced it once.

On 23 February, Barrasso listed the study’s projected job losses for the states that committee members represent, leading with Haaland’s state of New Mexico (62,000 jobs) and his state of Wyoming (33,000).

“My question is for you: why not just let these workers keep their jobs?” asked Barrasso.

Conservationists have criticized the study. It considers a permanent ban on new and existing leases, not the current 60-day pause on only new leases, and predicts job losses over a two-year period. The energy news website DeSmog noted that these predicted job losses far exceed the total number of employees in the oil and gas extraction industry, and described the claim as “staggering”.

The industry has nearly “500,000 acres of federal public lands leases they have not yet developed, 31,000+ existing federal public lands oil & gas wells, and a stockpile of ~5,000 approved-but-unused federal public lands drilling permits”, according to the executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center.

“This Chicken-Little routine from API and the Western Energy Alliance shouldn’t fool anyone,” said Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, a non-partisan conservation and advocacy organization.

“The oil industry ‘studies’ that Barrasso and company keep citing are directly contradicted by oil executives themselves, who rightly point out to investors that they’re sitting on tens of thousands of approved drilling permits and tens of thousands more unused oil leases.”

The Western Energy Alliance is a trade group of more than 200 oil and gas companies that is suing the Biden administration over its pause on new leases. In a press release announcing the suit, it cites the API study and another study that the Western Energy Alliance secretly financed and was written by a professor who has received funding from the Charles Koch Foundation and is known for publishing industry-funded propaganda.

At other times during the hearings, Barrasso referenced the API study’s job loss numbers for New Mexico and Wyoming and its national estimate of nearly 1m lost jobs. The senator claimed that lost revenue from oil and gas production on federal lands would cost states’ education systems, a claim that API promoted in its “EnergyCitizens” advertising campaign last fall.

Barrasso has another potential conflict of interest. He owns as much as $500,000 worth of stock in Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate whose subsidiaries’ pipelines transported 8% of the natural gas Americans consumed in 2019.

Hyde-Smith, whose campaigns have received $357,000 from oil and gas Pacs and employees, cited the API report’s claim of 14,000 job losses over two years and potentially $32m in lost revenue in her state, Mississippi. She also listed the study’s projected national 68% decrease in offshore natural gas production by 2030 and a big increase in oil imports.

“By halting this production of essential fossil fuels, Mississippi jobs alone would be just decimated,” Hyde-Smith said.

Haaland corrected Hyde-Smith, reminding her that the Biden administration had paused, not banned, new leases.

Hyde-Smith’s communications director Chris Gallegos did not answer questions about the study but said: “Senator Hyde-Smith does not base her votes on political support or contributions, but rather on what she believes is in the best interest of Mississippi and the nation.” The office of Barrasso did not return a request for comment.

Marcela Mulholland, political director of the progressive polling and research group Data for Progress, said: “Republican senators like John Barrasso and Cindy Hyde-Smith whose campaigns are bankrolled by fossil fuel billionaires have tried for years to push the narrative that voters must choose between a livable planet and good jobs.

“Voters aren’t buying it. Data for Progress polling shows that voters across the country reject the notion that creating jobs and transitioning to clean energy are mutually exclusive. The reality is that launching an all-out, government-wide mobilization to stop climate change has the potential to create millions of good jobs across the country.”

The energy committee will vote on whether to advance Haaland’s nomination on Thursday. With the support of the Maine Republican Susan Collins and conservative Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Haaland is expected to pass the test.

API has been generous to Republican candidates, including those on the energy committee.

In 2020, API gave $5m to the Senate Leadership Fund, which spent tens of millions of dollars to elect the Republican committee members Steve Daines of Wyoming ($24.7m), who pledged to block Haaland’s nomination, and Roger Marshall of Kansas ($17.5m). The Super Pac also spent money to help Collins and attack the Democratic committee members John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Mark Kelly of Arizona.

In 2018, Barrasso’s most recent election year, API’s Pac donated $7,500 to his campaign. In 2020, Hyde-Smith’s most recent election, it gave $2,000 to her campaign. In that cycle, the Pac contributed $19,500 to senators on the energy committee, all of them Republicans.

API funds national political committees that support state Republican candidates as well, having given $125,000 to the Republican Governors Association, $50,000 to the Republican Attorneys General Association, and $25,000 to the Republican State Leadership Committee in 2018.

The institute has also donated to Charles Koch-funded organizations such as Americans for Prosperity and the Cato Institute.

Oil and gas boosters avoid talking about Biden’s plan to create 10m clean energy jobs. While the transition from fossil fuel jobs to good-paying green jobs may be tricky, the world needs to drastically decrease its fossil fuel consumption by 2030 to avoid climate change-induced drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people, according to a UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report from 2018.

In addition, the effects of the climate crisis are already costing the US huge amounts of money and are predicted to demand hundreds of billions annually by 2090. In 2020, hurricanes, wildfires, and other disasters in the US – many that were caused or intensified by the climate crisis – cost $95bn.","['oil', 'used', 'deb', 'study', 'api', 'republicans', 'gas', 'committee', 'jobs', 'federal', 'climate', 'haaland', 'industrybacked', 'republican', 'criticize', 'energy']"
20,['Alex Hern'],"Kings of Leon are releasing their new album as a non-fungible token, or NFT, jumping on the craze for the digital assets akin to bitcoin, in cooperation with the tech startup Yellowheart.

The US rock group will sell two different types of NFT: one, which will be made available for a limited time, acts as a sort of deluxe version of the band’s new album When You See Yourself; the other, of which just six will be sold at auction, is effectively a lifetime ticket to the band’s shows.

The former token will be sold for $50 (£35.70), and comes with access to a digital download of the music and a vinyl, as well as other digital goods. The latter will probably be sold for somewhat more, but while only six will be sold, a total of 18 will be minted, which the band will be able to sell off in the future.

“Over the last 20 years – two lost decades – we’ve seen the devaluation of music,” YellowHeart’s chief executive, Josh Katz, told Rolling Stone, which first reported the band’s plans. “It’s early stages, but in the future, I think this will be how people release their tracks. When they sell 100,000 at a dollar each, then they just made $100,000.”

The NFT sector has been booming over the past month, thanks to a spillover of interest from the wider cryptocurrency industry. The technology allows artists, musicians, and others to “wrap” digital goods in code which allows it to be bought and sold in a decentralised way, creating a fully digital replication of the traditional art market.

On Monday, the artist and musician Grimes sold almost $6m of visual art in an NFT auction.

But the field has been criticised for its vast power use, and for the limited utility of the tokens themselves. Just one work of art by Grimes, sold in 303 editions, produced an estimated 70 tonnes of CO2 emissions as it was turned into an NFT. And while the tokens convey “ownership”, they don’t provide significant actual use, providing an explanation for why the Kings of Leon NFT comes with the addition of a decidedly non-digital vinyl copy of the album.","['tokens', 'digital', 'sell', 'art', 'nft', 'vinyl', 'bands', 'nonfungible', 'token', 'leon', 'album', 'release', 'sold', 'kings']"
21,['Rich Pelley'],"The Beatles

I am the youngest of seven, so I got a steady diet of the Beatles from my brothers and sisters at a young age. The Beatles first came to the United States in 1964 when I was four. It’s remarkable how much these boys with the skinny ties changed the world by the time they released Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967.

I loved the political aspects of John Lennon, the intrigue and impact of Yoko Ono and whether she was really responsible for breaking up the band. Their “bed-ins for peace” sit-in was so provocative. Every Christmas they still put up a billboard in Times Square that says: “War is over! If you want it.” The important part of that statement is: if you want it. I have always felt that human beings have such a terrible love of war that they don’t seem to want to find peaceful solutions. When you think about it, almost every Beatles song is about peace and love.

Midnight Cowboy at the drive-in next door

I was born in Loma Linda, California. My father was a drive-in theatre manager, so we moved around a lot. We moved to Imperial Beach then Utah when he became general manager of a half-dozen drive-in theatres. Utah has all the influences of the Mormon church. Listening to the Beatles in Utah would have been tantamount to listening to devil music.

The houses we lived in were adjacent to the drive-in so I could watch the movies right from the porch. During the summer, I was at the drive-in all the time. Cars would park between two speakers on a pole and I’d just watch the movie sitting on the ground between the speakers.

If Midnight Cowboy came out today, it would probably be a PG13. It’s not really shocking at all. In 1969, it was X-rated. Normally an X-rated film would be playing at a little low-rent theatre in some seedy part of town. At my father’s drive-in, people could accidentally see something risque or obscene as they drove by and so the church got very upset and angry.

Oliver!

In those days, the film companies would send these 16mm movie trailers to the drive-in theatre managers to try to sell their movies. They would also send these making-of movies. I remember seeing the making of Oliver! with Mark Lester. It was the first time that I saw children acting as a profession; you could see them taking singing and dancing lessons. And so I thought: “Well, that’s what I want to do.”

We were living in Orem, Utah, and there was a tap-dancing school in Provo, just down the road. My father got me this beautiful pair of patent leather tap-dance shoes but he couldn’t afford to send me every week on his drive-through wages, so I got a book and a record and learned how to tap dance: step, heel, toe, ball, step, change, turn. Maybe once a month, I went to class to try to keep up with the other kids. Then I joined the glee club in junior high school, and amateur theatricals and productions through high school.

The Man Who Would Be King

I had seen Sean Connery singing and dancing in Darby O’Gill and the Little People. Then of course I saw him in James Bond. But it wasn’t until I saw him in The Man Who Would Be King and Outland that I started to understand that Sean Connery wasn’t really a spy or an astronaut; and that acting was a profession and this was a profession that I wanted to follow in.

I met Sean Connery in New York City. Connery co-founded the Friends of Scotland charity in 2002 and every year they hold this charity fashion dinner called Dressed to Kilt. Over dinner, I told him about seeing him in all these different movies and how special it was meeting my childhood icon now I was a grownup. He was such a gentleman; he was so kind. He told me that after I had done Birdy in 1984 with Nicolas Cage, he had called [Bugsy Malone and Birdy director] Sir Alan Parker and said that he wished he could act like Modine. You could never imagine Sean Connery playing a character like Birdy, but he had enough of an appreciation of the sensitivity of the role that he wished that he could play a character like that.

The Old Man and the Sea

Ernest Hemingway’s novel The Old Man and the Sea had a tremendous impact on me because it’s about this one individual, the old man going out on the sea. I loved the ocean as a boy. I was a surfer, and the language that Hemingway uses is so evocative. It is so sensual that you can almost taste the little sardines and flying fish. You can picture the old man’s struggle to land the giant marlin as he holds on to it at the end of his fishing line for two days. When the shark devours the marlin, you can sympathise with the old man that he won’t be able to bring it home to feed so many people.

Like it or not, we all have to go through things like this in life. We go through life with the assistance and help of others, but we go to sleep and we wake up by ourselves. The Old Man and the Sea is a great book about self-reliance and it is so beautifully told. It’s like Billy Joel says in You’re Only Human: “You’re allowed to make your share of mistakes / You better believe there will be times in your life when you’ll be feeling like a stumbling fool”.

The cold war

We were taught the American civil war at school but glossed over the first world war. When we got to the second world war, we skipped the European history and were taught that it was the great hero America who saved the world from the Nazis with the atomic bomb.

When I did Mrs Soffel with Diane Keaton and Mel Gibson in 1984, I was invited to the Berlin film festival. I said: “I can’t go to East Berlin, I’m American.” They said: “No, you can go to East Berlin because you’re an American.”

Checkpoint Charlie was the opposite of The Wizard of Oz; it seemed to go from colour into black-and-white. There were still broken bits of concrete; it felt like the buildings were still on fire. They took me to the Soviet war memorial for 80,000 Soviet troops who had lost their lives taking Berlin. I met these Russian soldiers and gave them American cigarettes and they gave me pins from their uniforms. Back in Reagan’s America, it was still the cold war, and Russia was the enemy of choice for every movie and television show, and I just didn’t want to part of perpetuating that lie. So that’s why I turned down the Tom Cruise role in Top Gun. I did Full Metal Jacket, which was much better!","['beatles', 'war', 'matthew', 'utah', 'drivein', 'man', 'obsessions', 'music', 'photograph', 'connery', 'teenage', 'old', 'world', 'modines', 'sean', 'devil']"
22,['Charles Bramesco'],"In retrospect, it’s clear why America’s imperial project in Vietnam failed back in the ‘60s: you can’t win a war when your army doesn’t want to fight. In desperate need of soldiers to send into battle, instituting the draft seemed like the only option for the US military, when in actuality this choice was more like their great undoing.

Rounding up thousands of men and forcing them to ship out under fear of arrest instead of their own ideological volition created a fractious fighting force at odds with itself, unenthusiastic to resentful to outright insubordinate. A lot of the ordinary guys who weren’t already enlisting against their will soon joined the internal counter-cause after realizing they had been made pawns in a conflict fought over obscure financial imperatives, rather than any pretense of justice. To die face down in a rice paddy defending capitalism just didn’t have the noble luster of upholding all that was right against the dastardly Nazis; Americans understood Vietnam as the country’s first “bad war”, in which the presumed protagonists in the west came to suspect they might be the villains.

The FTA Show took shape as the inevitable consequence of this unrest at home and abroad. Led by Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland with backing from activist folk musicians such as Len Chandler, the anti-USO variety extravaganza channeled the moment’s bitterness and frustration into rollickingly subversive protest-tainment. (The title tune clarifies the four-letter profanity directed at the army.) A little-screened 1972 documentary under the truncated title of FTA followed their tour of active bases from Hawaii to the Philippines to Japan, each performance packed to the rafters with disillusioned GIs eager to hear an alternative to the rah-rah party line of their “jailers”, as Fonda joked. The film spent barely a week in theaters before quietly vanishing from the schedule; director Francine Parker claimed that the distributor, American International Pictures, backed down upon receiving a call directly from the White House. But now, a restoration completed in 2009 has at last received a public release, sounding out a once-elusive call of defiance for all to hear.

The ragtag band of hippies, radicals and merry pranksters sought to turn the “political vaudeville” of Bob Hope on its head with satirical songs and skits undercutting the chain of command. Draftees often loathed their order-barking commanding officers, a contempt easily translated into MAD Magazine-styled punch lines. In one comic interstitial, a general asks one of his troops for a quarter, who offers it with an informal “Sure!” The senior-ranking serviceman chews out his underling for the familiarity and asks for the quarter again, this time receiving a hearty “No, sir!” In this instance as in many others, the spirit of disobedience compensates for the rather mild humor, not quite as uproarious as Laugh-In yet 10 times as dangerous. A musical number like Nothing Could Be Finer Than to Be in Indochina! is more bracing than anything else, hollering what many considered unspeakable from the top of the singer’s lungs.

Extensive interview segments bolster the boldfaced ideology with testimony from the men on the ground, and on both sides of the conflict. Among the most controversial elements was an introductory title card stating that the film had been produced in cooperation with not just GIs, but also their “friends” whose “lands they presently occupy”. The camera crew had no trouble finding Americans and Japanese united in a wish for the armed forces to vacate Okinawa and leave the island be, or Filipino demonstrators articulating a shared desire with the GIs to get them home. The military seems to alienate its people along every personal line, whether it be race (black soldiers discuss the discrimination they face among their own ranks, and the hypocrisy of fighting for a country that couldn’t care less about them), gender (Fonda’s song I’m Tired of Bastards Fuckin’ Over Me calls out sexism and harassment), or class (volunteers from dirt-poor communities realize that they’re risking their lives to make rich men richer).

The scant straight-faced moments – Sutherland reading an excerpt from Dalton Trumbo’s Johnny Got His Gun, Okinawan musicians somberly singing in their native tongue – emphasize that the rabble-rousing show aspired to more than simple provocation. The opposition came from a place of compassion, a stance not of hatred for the soldiers themselves, but for the establishment powers-that-be forcing them to act against their own interest. The film makes sense of a dissonance that compelled conservatives at the time to wonder why “Hanoi Jane” wouldn’t just leave America, if she hated it so much. With 20/20 hindsight, we can see that it was specifically because she and her comrades loved the country that they devoted their energies and risked their reputations to better it, their criticisms the ultimate act of patriotism.","['title', 'vietnam', 'war', 'unearthing', 'antivietnam', 'fta', 'jane', 'sutherlands', 'receiving', 'men', 'gis', 'donald', 'quarter', 'fonda', 'film', 'soldiers', 'sutherland']"
23,['Steven Poole'],"The former first minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, has alleged that there is a “malicious and concerted effort” to denigrate him, causing others to accuse him of throwing around “conspiracy theories”. But what is a conspiracy, exactly?

Our English word comes from the Latin conspirare, which literally means “to breathe together”, and apart from the sense of people whispering among themselves to plot crimes it could also describe musicians playing horns together or people acting in other kinds of positive harmony. This sense was once available in English, too – as when Philip Sidney describes how a man might feel about his beloved, that “the conspiracie of her severall graces held best together to make one perfect figure of beautie” – as well as in the alternative “conspiration”, ie aspiring with others.

In modern times the phrase “conspiracy theory” is, oddly, applied only to purely factitious or imaginary conspiracies, ones about alien lizards or paedophile rings run out of pizza joints, for which we might want to blame Karl Popper’s description of “the conspiracy theory of society” in 1952. In the meantime, breathing along with others right now would put you at risk of Covid-19, so any sort of conspiracy is firmly inadvisable.

24,['Peter Bradshaw'],"Pietro Marcello is the director who recently gave us the much-praised drama Martin Eden, transposing the Jack London novel to Italy. Now he has made this documentary, a labour-of-love tribute to one of Bologna’s most favoured sons: the musician and singer-songwriter Lucio Dalla. It’s probably addressed to Dalla’s existing fanbase, rather than newcomers (which I admit includes me) but this is an engaging study, opening a window into the heart of postwar Italy, and incidentally gives a cameo role to this newspaper.



Dalla emerges from the film somewhere between America’s Bob Dylan and France’s Jacques Brel, but otherwise completely in a genre of his own. He was a former cherubic child star who acted, sang and played instruments and grew up to be a somewhat disconcertingly unprepossessing and even ugly man: he cheerfully owned up to the nickname of ragno, or spider, due to his famously hirsute image. (Pictures of him in a swimming costume show someone almost covered in fur.) In his later years of fame and wealth, he actually owned a yacht called Catarro (or Phlegm), due to his habit of coughing and spluttering. But actually, he had a rather humorous and sensitive face, a little like Phil Collins.



Dalla had a successful recording career in jazz and pop, but he only became an Italian legend when he teamed up with the Bologna poet Roberto Roversi, who contributed lyrics – a kind of high-minded Bernie Taupin to Dalla’s Elton John – and the pair created complex and daring concept albums, with all kinds of bold commentary on Italian politics and society. A TV clip shows a round-table discussion, featuring politicians and journalists deferring to Dalla.

His most notable album was probably Automobili (or Automobiles) from 1976, about Italy’s love affair with cars, and particularly the now defunct endurance road race, the Mille Miglia, which took place annually to wild nationwide excitement from the 1920s to the 1950s. The opening track is a long riff, imagining the bland, pompous and evasive replies given by Fiat boss Gianni Agnelli to a journalist from the Guardian - although Dalla spells it out as the “Manchester Guardian” – about selling a stake in Fiat to Libya, with a possible loss of Italian jobs. What other pop star, anywhere in the world, could have created a song taken from Guardian headlines about the car industry and unemployment?



The documentary interviews Dalla’s devoted manager and friend Tobia Righi and uses a good deal of black-and-white archive footage of Bolognese life as that city was transformed into a place of crowded urban modernity. Perhaps it’s more for insiders and specialists, but this film is a taste of Italian life.","['italian', 'guardian', 'place', 'dallas', 'owned', 'life', 'opening', 'icon', 'review', 'lucio', 'probably', 'pop', 'star', 'portrait', 'musical']"
25,['Sam Levine'],"Sign up for the Guardian's Fight to Vote newsletter

Happy Thursday,

An effort to restrict voting is under way across America, but there are few places where that assault is more clear, and more urgent, than in Georgia. I know we’ve talked about Georgia before, but this week, I want to dig in to exactly what Georgia lawmakers are proposing to make it harder to vote right now and why it matters.

On Monday, the Georgia house of representatives approved a bill, HB531, that would implement sweeping changes to the state’s voting system. Among other measures, the bill would:

Require voters to provide identification information both with their absentee ballot application and the ballot itself.

Limit election officials to offer just two days of early voting on the weekends, one of which is required to be a Saturday.

Restrict early voting from 9am. to 5pm, with an option for election officials to extend hours from 7am to 7pm.

Give voters less time to request an absentee ballot.

Shorten the period for a runoff election from nine weeks to four.

In the state senate, there are also proposals to get rid of the state’s policy of automatically registering voters and to only allow voters to cast a ballot by mail if they are 65 or older or have a valid excuse. That would eliminate the so-called no-excuse absentee voting system Georgia Republicans – yes Georgia Republicans – enacted in 2005.

While proposals in states across the country are deeply alarming, the efforts in Georgia matter significantly for a few reasons:

They come after an election in which there was record turnout in the state, including surges among Black and other minority voters, which helped power Democrats to stunning upsets. Georgia officials, including top Republicans, loudly dismissed allegations of fraud and there were statewide recounts and audits to back them up. They evoke Georgia’s well-documented and ugly history of passing laws designed to make it harder for Black people to vote



“They are very draconian in their nature,” said Aunna Dennis, the executive director of the Georgia chapter of Common Cause, a government watchdog organization. “What we’re seeing is a reaction to a problem that literally does not exist here in Georgia. These bills catch all of that. These are streamlining and rolling back the hands of time.”

Some measures in the bill, like the provisions curbing early voting, appear to be a thinly veiled effort to restrict access to the ballot for minority voters. In the 2020 election, 8.6% of white early voters cast their ballots on weekends, compared with 13.1% of Asian Americans and 11.8% of Black voters, according to an analysis by the Center for New Data.

It is also well-known that many Black churches run “Souls to the Polls” events on Sundays to encourage parishioners to get out and vote. Under the new law, election officials could choose not to offer any Sunday voting at all.

“In Georgia, because we had to fight so hard to get the right to vote here, voting is very much celebrated. It’s very much a community event,” Dennis said. “We use those weekend times to do that. For those cuts to happen that dramatically, that can also decrease the will of the people to want to be a part of this election because they will see this is just so many hurdles.”

During the debate in the Georgia house this week, Republicans justified the new restrictions by saying that there should be uniformity in early voting hours. But Democrats pointed out that reasoning was nonsensical because counties could still offer differing weekend days.

There’s also concern about the requirement that voters provide identification information both when they apply to vote by mail and when they send in their ballot. Some voters, especially those who are poor, disabled or elderly, might lack access to a Georgia’s driver’s license or be able to send in a photocopy of another form of ID. On the ballot itself, Georgia voters who lack acceptable ID would be required to put the last four digits of their social security number – sparking concern that voters will be forced to put sensitive personal information at risk.

Lastly, there’s deep concern over new limits on ballot drop boxes, which voters relied on because of concerns about mail delays. While local election officials could offer access to drop boxes 24/7 in 2020, the new bill would only allow officials to place drop boxes in early voting locations and allow access to them during early voting hours. It would not allow ballot drop boxes to be open on election day and only allow one box for every 100,000 voters.

Janine Eveler, the director of elections in Cobb county, said her county spent a lot of money purchasing boxes and installing surveillance cameras last year. She was happy the state was at least allowing drop boxes to continue, but questioned the need for some of the new restrictions.

“Placing the boxes inside advance voting locations will disrupt the flow of in-person voters in the poll, so I would rather they be located outside the polls if they have to be associated with advance voting locations,” she wrote in an email. “I don’t understand why they want to limit the number of drop boxes by 1:100,000 voters.”

The proposals, and many smaller bills, are still moving through the legislature and it’s not yet entirely clear which ones will be ultimately approved. Dennis added that the bills sent a disturbing message to the voters who turned out in unprecedented numbers last year.

“What do we tell those voters? Do we tell them that their energy, their enthusiasm and the success of the election meant nothing?,” she said.
