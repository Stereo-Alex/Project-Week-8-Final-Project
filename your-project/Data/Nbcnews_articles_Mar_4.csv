Tyson, then 11, lived across the street from the corner where a police officer had knelt on Floyd’s neck until he stopped breathing.

As thousands of protesters gathered at East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in late May and early June, Tyson rode his scooter among them. He watched as they transformed the entire square into a memorial. He listened as they passed around a megaphone, giving speeches from morning until night. He paused and knelt to touch flowers left on the street, scattered over block letters spelling Floyd’s name, and the names of other people killed by police officers.

Often wearing a black cap that a protester gave him, with the words “I Can’t Breathe” written in yellow, Tyson chanted Floyd’s name with the demonstrators. He wrote “Rest In Peace” on a mural.

“It’s scary because anything could happen to a Black person in America,” said Tyson, whose father is Black and mother is white. “I truly am afraid that something like what happened to George Floyd might happen to anybody out here, especially my dad.”

In those early weeks after Floyd's death, Jamie LaBlanche, Tyson's father, often walked through the crowds at his son's side. Jamie, 34, who also has a Black father and a white mother, wanted Tyson to see a movement that he hoped would change the world.

Standing with Tyson in June outside Cup Foods, the corner store where they used to buy Hershey’s bars and chicken tenders, Jamie gestured at the makeshift memorial full of bouquets of flowers, candles and signs.

“This is where it was. Right here,” he told his son. “Everybody's out here right now to make sure that this type of stuff never happens again.”

Tyson and Jamie bore witness to the mass movement against police brutality and racial inequality as it unfurled in the heart of Minneapolis. Jamie has spent the past nine months grappling with teaching Tyson, the oldest of his three children, the importance of this historic moment while also protecting him. What was the line, he wondered, between educating his son about the trauma of violence and racism, and shielding him from that trauma?

""So many things I haven't been able to save him from seeing, hearing,” Jamie said. “It has made me question my fatherhood, and whether I'm doing a good job.""

Jamie, a delivery driver and part-time DJ, has always been transparent with Tyson about the risks of being a person of color. Jamie said he has been routinely harassed by the police since he was a teenager, and is stopped or pulled over at least once or twice a year. Once, officers pulled their guns on him and his friends when all they were doing was smoking weed, he said. He was 18.

“What I tell my son about racism and police brutality is he's a person of color and he can't forget that — no matter how light his skin is,” Jamie said. “He's going to have the same troubles that I've had and the same troubles that my father had. Just going to be a little bit different.”

Tyson used to want to become a police officer. When he saw law enforcement officers at the local Dairy Queen, he would give them a fist bump.

“But then once people started dying around me that had been killed by the police,” he said, “I kind of lost that.”

‘I think about him every day’

Floyd’s death wasn’t Tyson’s first experience with losing someone at the hands of police.

His father’s friend, Brian Quiñones, was shot and killed by police in September 2019. Tyson and Jamie have been mourning him ever since, attending vigils and memorials with Quiñones’ family. At these gatherings, Jamie plays music created by Quiñones, a 30-year-old aspiring hip-hop artist — a DJ keeping his friend’s memory alive.

The final minutes of Quiñones’ life were livestreamed on his Facebook account.

He was shot and killed by police after a pursuit in suburban Minneapolis ended with him stepping out of his car with a knife in his hand. His family has said he was suffering from mental health issues and depression. Quiñones had just released his latest album that day.

In emergency dispatch audio, officers could be heard yelling “drop the knife” before gunshots rang out.

“He was murdered for being mentally unstable and needing help,” Jamie said. “I think about him every day.”

The officers, who fired 18 bullets, were not charged; the county prosecutor called their use of force “necessary, proportional, and objectively reasonable.”

Tyson watched his father break down repeatedly in the days and weeks following his friend’s death, and struggled with seeing him suffer.

“I just felt bad for my dad that he had to go through such a loss,” Tyson said. “I feel like it’s not fair to him that he had to go through all that.""

Quiñones’ death moved Jamie to become active in the movement against police brutality. But his activism has driven a wedge between him and his younger sister, a sheriff’s deputy in a neighboring county. When they talk, they often argue. He feels she’s refusing to acknowledge the systemic racism built into policing; she has said the officers who shot Quiñones responded appropriately based on their training. The tension between them has only gotten worse since Floyd was killed, and they haven’t spoken in months, Jamie said. (Jamie’s sister declined to be interviewed.)

The deaths have changed how Tyson views the police, too.

“I understand you want to go back to your family,” Tyson said, in response to a question from a reporter about the way police justify fatal shootings. “But because of what you did, somebody else can’t go back to their families. George Floyd had two daughters and he never got to say goodbye to them.”

‘Your voice is important’

Two weeks after Floyd was killed, Tyson and Jamie attended a memorial and balloon release in Powderhorn Park, about a mile from their home, for the family and friends of those who had been killed by police, a grim bond tying them all together.

Tyson, wearing his black “I Can’t Breathe” cap and a white T-shirt with the names of people killed by law enforcement, watched as people held multicolored balloons and said the names of their loved ones.

Quiñones’ widow, Ashley, stood on a picnic table.

“My husband was Brian Quiñones. He was murdered by the police on September 7th of 2019,” she said.

Then she brought Courteney Ross, Floyd’s girlfriend, up to the table to speak.

“Floyd is here with us,” Ross said, struggling to get out the words. “He loves us. Thank you, father God, for giving us Floyd.”

Some in the crowd of dozens cried; others held one another.

Tyson hadn’t planned to say anything, but suddenly he felt moved to speak. He climbed onto the picnic table and faced the crowd.

“I loved somebody that died. His name was Brian Quiñones and they killed him,” Tyson said, his voice breaking. (Ed Ou / NBC News) “I loved somebody that died. His name was Brian Quiñones and they killed him,” Tyson said, his voice breaking. (Ed Ou / NBC News)

“We shouldn't have to see any more innocent Black men on the ground,” he said, raising his voice to be heard.

The crowd cheered him on.

“We shouldn't see police driving by and just seeing an innocent man and being able to kill them with no justice,” he continued.

The crowd cheered again.

Tyson lifted his black cap and briefly smiled. He paused.

“I loved somebody that died. His name was Brian Quiñones and they killed him,” he said, his voice breaking.

“Say his name, baby,” someone called.

Tyson wiped his eyes.

“Brian Quiñones!” he said, and the crowd chanted the name with him.

A single tear fell down Tyson’s cheek. He adjusted his cap again.

“I love every single one of you that had to lose somebody over these years,” he said. “And I'm so sorry.”

The crowd clapped and cheered as he finished. Tyson wiped his face with his T-shirt.

Jamie pulled Tyson into a hug. The two held each other tight as Jamie began to weep.

“I love you,” he told his son.

“I had to say it,” Tyson said.

“I know,” Jamie replied, looking his son in the eyes. “I’m so glad you said that.”

Jamie held his son’s chin.

“Your voice is important,” he said. “Not only to me, but to everybody. And you just proved that right now.”

‘Struggling on all fronts’

The corner where Jamie lived with his fiancée, Sami, their two children, Adelina, 4, and Jerome, 2, and Tyson, Jamie’s son from a previous relationship, became known as George Floyd Square. By day, it remained a gathering point where people came to remember Floyd and rally for racial equality.

At night, however, the square could take on a different tone. Jamie grew up in the area and there had always been gang activity, he said, but it had been heavily populated with foot and street traffic.

After the streets were blocked off after Floyd’s killing, Jamie noticed a rise in gang violence and shootings, which he saw as people taking advantage of fewer police officers being in the area. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that 11 people were shot near the intersection in the seven weeks after Floyd’s death, and that police were heard on scanners saying they would not respond to reports of gunfire in the square unless there was a victim. Police, meanwhile, said they were doing their jobs amid a “historic” crime surge and ongoing civil unrest.

While before Jamie had heard gunfire in the distance, now it was right at his door. Stray bullets pierced windows in the family’s home and lodged in walls. No one was hurt, but Jamie and Sami were terrified for their children’s safety.

One night in June, Jamie carried Jerome in his arms and led Adelina down to their new bedroom — in the basement.

He laid Jerome in a crib, wrapped him with a blanket and gave him a bottle of milk.

“Goodnight little baby, I love you,” he said, touching his son’s forehead before turning off the light.

The children would be sleeping there now, where Jamie and Sami hoped they would be safer than in the first-floor bedrooms.

The ongoing violence and tensions were taking a toll on Tyson, too. He felt always on guard, constantly looking outside to see and hear what was going on. He began to have trouble sleeping and would wake up in the middle of the night to gunfire.

Sometimes he found himself wishing Floyd’s death hadn’t happened so close to his home.

“He’s struggling on all fronts, just like I am,” Jamie said of his elder son. “I don’t know if I'm the one that’s doing harm to him by us being here.”

Eventually, it was too much. In midsummer, Jamie and Sami began looking for a new place to live, somewhere quieter, outside the city. But the search dragged on for months.

While Sami worked as a teacher, Jamie was taking care of the children full-time — someone needed to stay home with Tyson to help him with remote school, and Jamie was too worried about the children’s safety to leave them with someone else. The family’s single income made it harder to find another place to live, Jamie said.

“This is hell, living here. Having to watch my son suffer all the time and be worried and anxious,” Jamie said. “I still hold guilt because I don't know whether or not this is going to have long-term negative effects on my kids.”

‘Trying to heal’

After months of looking for a new home, Jamie and his family moved to Monticello, a suburb about 50 minutes northwest of Minneapolis, in October. Jamie had some friends in the area, and it was one of the only communities within the family’s budget.

“I do feel like a sense of privilege that we were able to get the hell out of there even though it took forever,” Jamie said in January. “I feel guilty for the people of color who don’t have any other option.”

He still grapples with the idea of leaving the place he grew up in, and leaving behind many people he cares about, to move to a more conservative area. The town of less than 14,000 is more than 86 percent white and voted for Donald Trump last fall by a nearly 20-point margin.

Jamie said leaving George Floyd Square was both “so comforting and uncomfortable at the same time.”

“I don’t know if we know where we fit in yet,” he said. “But we’re trying to heal, and get into a more ‘normal’ functional type of everyday life.”

Jamie and Tyson have both started therapy. Jamie, who works as a delivery driver for Papa John’s, said he’d recently been offered a management position there. He’s focusing on work and his role as a father, but he also wants to continue fighting for justice for Quiñones.

Tyson had mixed feelings about the move. He missed his friends and the familiar faces he used to see in the square. But in their old neighborhood, he felt that his family’s lives were in danger. He still has trouble sleeping and is afraid of the pop of fireworks.

The new neighborhood has been quiet and feels safer. “I feel a lot better not having to worry as much,” Tyson said.

But Tyson has also felt uncomfortable. One time, he said, a convenience store clerk, who was wearing a Trump-themed mask, accused him of shoplifting and made him empty his bag; he believes she targeted him because he was wearing his “I Can’t Breathe” hat and a Black Lives Matter mask. He said another worker saw what was happening and apologized, allowing him to leave.

Generally, though, Tyson said he’s making friends in his new neighborhood, and is happy to sometimes just be bored. He rides his bicycle around even in the snow, plays sports video games with Jamie and searches for his siblings during hide-and-seek. For his 12th birthday recently, some friends from Minneapolis visited, and they all went sledding together.

“I felt amazing. I rarely get to say that. That one moment probably made my whole month,” Tyson said.

He added, “I get to be a kid now.”","['ed', 'george', 'reckons', 'floyd', 'minneapolis', 'tyson', 'growing', 'killed', 'violence', 'jamie', 'quiñones', 'block', 'nbc', 'family', 'ou']",

The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, H.R. 1280, passed 220-212 — although a Republican representative said he'd voted yes by mistake and changed the official record to reflect his opposition.

Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, tweeted that he'd pressed the wrong button and voted for the bill by accident.

A version of the bill passed last year but stalled in the Senate, which was then under Republican control. The House bill passed Wednesday night still has to go to the Senate, where it will need at least 10 Republican votes for passage.

The bill is named after Floyd, the Black man who died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for minutes. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired, and he faces charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter. His trial and jury selection are scheduled to begin Monday.

The bill, among other things, would ban neck restraints and ""no knock"" warrants in drug cases at the federal level. It would also reform qualified immunity, which is a doctrine that makes it difficult to sue officers.

Some places have already taken such steps. Colorado last year ended qualified immunity as a defense for officers in state courts.

The Biden administration threw its support behind the bill Monday. The White House said trust between law enforcement and communities can't be rebuilt unless police officers are held accountable for abuses of power.

Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., who introduced the bill, said she is confident that House members will be able to work with the Senate to get it passed. She said that after the last bill passed, ""many of our Republican colleagues said they thought they could get to yes on this, but they had some difficulties.""

""One of the things that has happened in the last 12 months, though, is that many states moved ahead without us, and they started passing reforms,"" Bass said. ""So, this time, when we sit down to meet, we can talk about reforms that are already in place.""

Benjamin Crump and Antonio Romanucci, attorneys for the Floyd family, said that on behalf of the family ""we are deeply gratified and grateful"" in House leadership, and they urged the Senate to pass the bill.

""This represents a major step forward to reform the relationship between police officers and communities of color and impose accountability on law enforcement officers whose conscious decisions preserve the life or cause the death of Americans, including so many people of color,"" they said in a statement.","['reform', 'george', 'floyd', 'act', 'immunity', 'senate', 'house', 'officers', 'passes', 'qualified', 'bill', 'named', 'republican', 'passed']",2021-03-04 04:48:00+00:00
8,"['Dartunorro Clark', 'Dartunorro Clark Is A Political Reporter For Nbc News.']","The House on Wednesday passed the For the People Act, a sweeping bill that seeks to change campaign finance, voting and ethics laws.

The bill would expand access to the ballot box by creating automatic voter registration across the country, restoring the voting rights of the formerly incarcerated, expanding early voting and modernizing America's voting systems.

The House measure passed 220-210, with one Democrat joining all Republicans in voting against it.

The bill would also strengthen oversight of political lobbying and campaign finance by preventing members of Congress from serving on corporate boards and requiring presidents to release their tax returns.

Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., first introduced the legislation, also known as H.R. 1, in 2019, when it passed the House but it stalled in the Senate, which was controlled by Republicans at the time. He reintroduced the act in January.

""The 2020 election underscored the need for comprehensive, structural democracy reform. Americans across the country were forced to overcome rampant voter suppression, gerrymandering and a torrent of special-interest dark money just to exercise their vote and their voice in our democracy,"" Sarbanes said in a statement.

Former President Donald Trump promised to release his financial records in full, but he ultimately refused to release his tax returns while he was president and as a candidate. Since his election defeat, Republican state legislators have proposed tighter voting restrictions.

The White House Office of Management and Budget released a statement Monday in support of the bill, which would also commit to restore the Voting Rights Act, combat voter purging and reform redistricting.

President Joe Biden said in a statement Thursday that he would work with Congress to refine and advance the bill and applauded its passage following the events leading up to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol and state-level efforts to pass restrictive voting laws.

""The right to vote is sacred and fundamental — it is the right from which all of our other rights as Americans spring,"" Biden said in touting the bill's provisions. ""This landmark legislation is urgently needed to protect that right, to safeguard the integrity of our elections, and to repair and strengthen our democracy.""

However, the filibuster may stand in the way of the bill's passage in the Senate.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked Monday whether Biden supports abolishing the filibuster to pass the bill.

""The president is committed to protecting the fundamental right to vote and making it easier for all eligible Americans to vote,"" she said. ""We're not going to get ahead of the process. The president's view on the filibuster is well known.

9,"['Mark L. Wolf', 'Mark L. Wolf Is A U.S. District Judge In Massachusetts', 'Chair Of Integrity Initiatives International.']","Before the unsuccessful military coup to remove Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as president of Turkey in 2016, I was working with the leaders of the Turkish Justice Academy. They were honest, able judges who were inspired by the ability of judges in the United States to be impartial and independent of the president. Among other things, I was teaching about the importance of judicial proceedings' and records' being open to the media and the public, as they are in the United States as a way to hold judges accountable.

Confidence in the U.S. judiciary at home and abroad would be enhanced if the Supreme Court were, by statute, required to broadcast its proceedings.

The day after the attempted coup, Erdoğan had all of my Turkish colleagues, and almost 3,000 other judges and prosecutors, arrested off of lists prepared before the coup for allegedly being part of a terrorist network. My colleagues report that many judges died in prison, some by suicide. Others were jailed for several years, and some still are, as Erdoğan has solidified his control of the judiciary.

With honest, independent judges out of the way, Erdoğan proceeded to jail thousands of professors, journalists and politicians, as well. This followed a pattern. Three years earlier prosecutors brought corruption charges against members of Erdoğan's Cabinet and released a recording purported to reveal Erdoğan telling his son to get tens of millions in cash out of his house before it was searched. Erdoğan promptly removed the prosecutors.

In essence, judges and prosecutors in Turkey have been persecuted for striving to be like judges and prosecutors in the United States, working independently as part of the system of checks and balances needed to protect against the abuse of power by elected officials, which is important to democracy. Their plight is a reminder of the historic importance of the United States as an inspiring model and of the countless people around the world who have the courage of our convictions.

Persecuted judges in Turkey and elsewhere should be encouraged by the House of Representatives' vote Wednesday on sweeping legislation, known as H.R. 1, to diminish unethical conduct by elected officials, including the president and the vice president, and by Supreme Court justices as well. Among other things, the bill would require a code of conduct for justices, who are the only U.S. judges not governed by an ethical code.

As the Brennan Center for Justice has reported, ""Over the last two decades, almost all members of the Supreme Court have been criticized for engaging in behaviors that are forbidden to other federal court judges."" These include participating ""in partisan convenings and fundraisers, accepting expensive gifts or travel, making partisan comments at public events or in the media, or failing to recuse themselves from cases involving apparent conflicts of interest, either personal or financial.""

The legitimacy of the Supreme Court depends on public confidence that its decisions are principled, not political. Rightly or wrongly, that confidence has been eroded by decisions perceived to be partisan, as well as by the partisan rancor accompanying recent confirmation battles. A code of conduct for the justices would increase public confidence in their decisions.

In addition, as the United States regularly advocates for transparency as a check against misconduct and corruption, confidence in the U.S. judiciary at home and abroad would be enhanced if the Supreme Court were, by statute, required to broadcast its proceedings and allow the broadcasting of proceedings in the lower federal courts. Senators who have unsuccessfully introduced legislation to do so can now renew that effort when acting on H.R. 1.

However, if the United States is to remain an inspiring model of democracy, much more than improvements concerning the Supreme Court is necessary. The new legislation recognizes this, as it is intended to ""strengthen ethics rules for public servants, and implement other anti-corruption measures for the purpose of fortifying our democracy."" Those measures include requiring the president and the vice president to disclose their tax returns, prohibiting them from profiting from public expenditures and generally requiring that they adhere to the same ethical standards as all other government employees. H.R. 1 also includes measures to protect against foreign influence in U.S. elections.

However, the United States must do more than repair its democracy to restore its influence internationally. As Samantha Power, nominated by President Joe Biden to head the U.S. Agency for International Development, has rightly recognized, autocrats and populists are on the rise, and they are almost invariably corrupt. ""Corruption is a key area of vulnerability for autocrats,"" Power has noted. There is a ""desire of citizens around the world to see corruption and lawlessness investigated by independent bodies, a general principle they should know the United States stands behind.""

Recognizing this, President Biden is making promoting democracy and combating corruption pillars of his foreign policy. Among other things, he has pledged to convene a Summit for Democracy this year to galvanize commitments from other countries for ""fighting corruption, defending against authoritarianism, and advancing human rights in their own nations and abroad.""

Critics, however, contend that in view of the dysfunction of American democracy that culminated in the insurrection at the Capitol and the second impeachment of President Donald Trump, the United States no longer has the standing to lecture other countries. They argue that it would be counterproductive and, indeed, hypocritical for the president to invite countries such as Turkey, Hungary, Poland and the Philippines — ""all U.S. allies or partners with leaders who have taken notable steps away from democracy."" Thus, the critics assert, this is the wrong time for President Biden's summit.

However, the events that have prompted this criticism actually make this the ideal time for the United States to host a summit. That summit should include democratic allies, such as Canada and the United Kingdom. If it is necessary to invite the leaders of Turkey and other increasingly undemocratic countries, there should also be a seat at the table for citizens struggling for democracy there.

The summit should be one at which the United States seeks to learn as well as to lead. The challenges to democracy in this country today are familiar to many around the world. For example, as Yale professor Timothy Snyder explained in ""On Tyranny,"" Ukraine in 2013 responded swiftly and effectively to a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at undermining its presidential election, while the United States was slow to recognize and try to rebut a comparable Russian effort in 2016. Snyder wisely concluded that, ""since so much of what has happened [in the United States] is familiar to the rest of the world or from recent history, we must observe and listen.""

The United States can both listen and lead. The United States still has formidable independent media that expose corruption, as well as impartial judges who hold even presidents accountable. We often elect those who combat corruption to high office and elevate others to judgeships. (I myself was appointed a federal judge after being the chief federal prosecutor of public corruption in Massachusetts.) And, despite the insurrection at the Capitol, the world has again seen a peaceful transition of power that would be inconceivable in countries ruled by authoritarian kleptocrats.

Biden is making promoting democracy and combating corruption pillars of his foreign policy. Among other things, he has pledged to convene a Summit for Democracy.

Nevertheless, the power of the United States' example is not enough. The United States should demonstrate its commitment to those people abroad who yearn to see autocratic kleptocrats held accountable. The United States should, for example, amend the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to authorize the prosecution of kleptocrats who demand bribes, as well as the businesses that pay them. In addition, the United States should support the growing movement to create an International Anti-Corruption Court that has been catalyzed by Integrity Initiatives International, which I chair. The court would be a fair forum for prosecuting corrupt leaders who control the administration of justice in the countries they rule — a court of last resort similar to, but distinct from, the International Criminal Court.

Some Turkish judges have been released from prison and made dangerous escapes to other countries. They were dismayed by events in the United States after the 2020 presidential election. They are now encouraged by President Biden's pledge to promote democracy and combat corruption internationally and to convene a summit to prompt other countries to join us in that effort.

The United States has long inspired these judges and many others not because it is perfect, but because it has been properly perceived as striving to give integrity to its democratic principles. The United States now has the opportunity to give renewed integrity and energy to its never-ending quest to deserve and preserve its standing as the world's best hope. President Biden's initiatives have the potential to do that.

I too have prayed for Asian American films like “Minari” to receive all manner of major awards. But a best foreign language award was not what I had in mind. Like most Asian Americans, I have faced the perpetual foreigner stereotype all of my life. I frequently field questions of “where are you really from?” and I’ve been told to “go back to China.” So when “Minari” was nominated in the foreign language category and excluded from competing for best drama, Asian Americans let out a collective groan. And when it won, what should have been a moment of collective joy felt like the award equivalent to the backhanded compliment: “Your English is so good!""

Like most Asian Americans, I have faced the perpetual foreigner stereotype all of my life. I frequently field questions of “where are you really from?”

“Minari” is a beautiful film written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung, based on his own upbringing on a farm in rural Arkansas. The film shows a Korean American family overcoming hardships in pursuit of the American dream. It is, obviously, an American story. The catch? Much of the dialogue was in Korean, which under Golden Globe rules disqualified it from the top categories. The official rules state that films must have “50% or more English dialogue” to contend for the best motion picture prizes in drama or musical/comedy. Films in any other language are therefore siloed.

Even though I grew up in California, there were scenes in “Minari” that resonated with my own life. Like the movie’s young son David, I also cringingly told my grandmother “you smell” when she came to visit us in the United States. When the Yi family visits a local church for the first time and a white boy turns around in the pews to stare at David in confusion, I had flashbacks to my entire childhood. To call “Minari” a “foreign language film” felt like a negation of my own American story and that of so many Americans from immigrant families.

As Lulu Wang, director of “The Farewell,” tweeted when nominations were announced in December: “I have not seen a more American film than #Minari this year. It's a story about an immigrant family, IN America, pursuing the American dream. We really need to change these antiquated rules that characterizes American as only English-speaking.” Wang’s excellent “The Farewell” — another film about an Asian American family — was also nominated the year before for a best foreign language Golden Globe award because of its majority-Mandarin dialogue.

I have not seen a more American film than #Minari this year. It's a story about an immigrant family, IN America, pursuing the American dream. We really need to change these antiquated rules that characterizes American as only English-speaking. https://t.co/1NZbkJFE9v — Lulu Wang (@thumbelulu) December 23, 2020

“The Farewell,” which starred New York-born actress (and non-native Mandarin speaker) Awkwafina, is just more evidence of why the Globes’ rule is both outdated and discriminatory. English is not even the official language of the United States (hint: there is none). In fact, 21.6 percent of Americans (ages 5 and older) speak a language other than English at home. Given that immigrants and their children make up more than 25 percent of the U.S. population, films like “Minari” and “The Farewell” should be recognized for what they are — American stories.

Another problem with the English dialogue rule is that it is inconsistently applied. In 2012, “The Artist,” a French silent film with no dialogue, was nominated for and won the Golden Globe award for best musical or comedy. Furthermore, foreign European films are regularly nominated for the top prizes. This year, “The Father,” a French-British co-production with a French director, was nominated for best drama. But “Minari” — a U.S. production, with a U.S. director — was barred from competing for the top prize. This makes no sense if the point is to divide “foreign” from “domestic.”

In a climate of heightened anti-Asian violence, labeling an Asian American film like “Minari” “foreign” feels even more offensive.

In a climate of heightened anti-Asian violence, labeling an Asian American film like “Minari” “foreign” feels even more offensive. Advocacy groups like “Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate” have received more than 2,800 reported incidents of racism and discrimination targeting Asian Americans across the United States. Asian Americans report physical assaults along with verbal harassment like “stop bringing that Chinese virus over here.” At the core of these attacks is a xenophobic perception of Asian Americans as foreign threats. While anti-Asian racism is not new, the recent uptick has been fueled by the government using words like “foreign virus” and “Chinese virus.” The World Health Organization has condemned the usage of such language and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have criticized the phrases as “inaccurate and potentially harmful in promoting racist associations.” Consequently, the label of “foreign” (even if celebratory), is misleading at best and dangerous at worst.

The Golden Globes needs to be like the Academy Awards and allow films of any language to compete for best picture in either drama or comedy. In 2020, the South Korean film “Parasite” won the best picture Oscar, making history as the first non-English film to win the award. To go from celebrating the win of “Parasite” to a consolation prize for ""Minari"" feels bittersweet. (If “Minari” receives a best picture Oscar nomination this year, that would feel like redemption.)

Lee Isaac Chung’s acceptance speech drove home how “Minari” is not limited by any language. “‘Minari’ is about a family,” he explained. “It's a family trying to learn to speak a language of its own. It goes deeper than any American language and any foreign language. It's a language of the heart, and I'm trying to learn it myself and to pass it on, and I hope we'll all learn how to speak this language of love to each other, especially this year.""

Hollywood needs to recognize that whatever language Asian Americans choose to speak is American, because we are Americans.","['asian', 'treatment', 'american', 'language', 'best', 'foreign', 'dream', 'americans', 'hollywoods', 'films', 'film', 'family', 'minari']",2021-03-03 22:37:00+00:00
11,['Diep Tran'],"Steven Yeun has seen your outcry over ""Minari""'s being placed in the foreign language film category at the Golden Globes, and he is appreciative.

In many ways, the film and the ensuing protest highlight what many people think is the Asian American experience — walking the line between two cultures and not having a solid footing in either. But Yeun said the reality is more complicated — that Asian America can be its own third identity, separate from Asian and American. ""We live in this isolated, liminal space. And that's all right,"" Yeun said over Zoom.

""Minari,"" about a Korean American family's putting down roots in Arkansas in the 1980s, is primarily in Korean, and it is made by an American director and an American production company. So when the news came that it was eligible to compete only in the best foreign language film category and not best film because of the multilingual script, people objected online.

Yeun said the rule shows a lack of recognition of America's diversity: Many Americans speak multiple languages.

""We can't expect rules and institutions to really capture the nuance and the complexity of real life — that America is not just shaped by the English language. It's actually a confluence of so many things,"" Yeun said. ""I think for us to have made something that is challenging these notions and attempting, hopefully, to expand the understanding of what these things are, that's great. I'm glad people are waking up to it.""

Yeun plays a man from Korea named Jacob, who dreams of going beyond his job in a chicken factory. He wants to own a farm and to sell Korean fruits and vegetables to the Korean community. ""Every year 30,000 Koreans move to the United States. Wouldn't they miss Korean food?"" he tells his daughter.

""Minari,"" which won the Grand Jury Prize and an Audience Award when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last year, comes with enthusiastic early buzz. It has earned Yeun a Screen Actors Guild nomination for outstanding performance by a male actor in a leading role; he is the first Asian American to be nominated in that category. The film will have a theatrical release on Friday and then be available on demand on Feb. 26.

""Minari"" was written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung, who based it on his own family, who owned a farm in Arkansas.

So what is Asian America to Yeun? ""It's really just a confidence in our own existence. I think, oftentimes, because we only have the parameters of Korea (or Asia, or a mother country) and America, we have to pick a side and pick little bits and pieces to help us find ourselves. And while that can work, it often ends up sounding like I have a foot in both. And the truth is I don't have a foot in both. I just have a foot in my own thing — like our own intrinsic third culture.""

For Yeun, the story in ""Minari"" is intensely personal. For one, Chung is his wife's cousin, although the two hadn't talked extensively until Chung sent him the script for “Minari.” ""I had seen his first film, 'Munyurangabo,' on a date with my wife,"" said Yeun, who is an executive producer on ""Minari.""

Yeun's family immigrated to Canada and later Michigan during the '80s. ""Minari"" has been a way for him not just to tell an Asian American story, but also to explore what Asian America is — at least for himself.

Yeun rose to fame killing zombies on ""The Walking Dead"" before he starred in critically acclaimed films such as Bong Joon-ho's ""Okja,"" Boots Riley's ""Sorry to Bother You"" and Lee Chang-dong's ""Burning.""

Having worked in both the American and Korean film industries, Yeun has compared the Korean American identity to ""pizza with kimchi."" But it's actually much more complex than that. ""Even the pizza and kimchi thing, I was just kind of talking off the cuff. And even that fails to define what I'm talking about,"" he said. ""I'm still thinking this through.""

So what is Asian America to Yeun? ""It's really just a confidence in our own existence,"" he said. ""I think, oftentimes, because we only have the parameters of Korea (or Asia, or a mother country) and America, we have to pick a side and pick little bits and pieces to help us find ourselves. And while that can work, it often ends up sounding like I have a foot in both. And the truth is I don't have a foot in both. I just have a foot in my own thing — like our own intrinsic third culture.""

""Minari"" has not only made Yeun rethink what it is to be Asian American; it has also made him rethink his family history. Yeun, at 37, is now around the same age his father was when he immigrated from Korea. The character of Jacob was formed both by Yeun's recollections of his own father and by his own experience as a father of two.

""I started to realize that I am my father in some ways,"" he said. ""I see what drove him. I see how I misunderstood him. I can see a little bit clearly his intentions that I read as oppression — I see it, and I can see how we can misunderstand each other.""

Yeun was careful not to turn Jacob into a typical stoic Asian patriarch. Yes, Jacob argues with his wife and is frustrated by the day-to-day difficulties of being an immigrant in America. But he is also affectionate with his family, even playful; on their first night in Arkansas, Jacob suggests that the family all sleep together on the floor in the living room.

""Oftentimes, I think the collective understanding of who our Asian dads are — as, like, a meme, almost — gets in the way of admitting who they actually were and seeing them for the human beings that they are.""

""Oftentimes, I think the collective understanding of who our Asian dads are — as, like, a meme, almost — gets in the way of admitting who they actually were and seeing them for the human beings that they are,"" Yeun said. ""Sometimes they know how to express their love to you. And then other times, they're completely unable to be emotional about something. They're just human beings.""

That paternal energy translated to how Yeun treated his younger costars; Jacob has two kids in the film, one played by eight-year-old Alan S. Kim. ""Minari"" is Alan's first film, and Yeun gave him some acting advice on the set: ""He said, 'Don't rush and just be yourself,'"" said Alan, who said Yeun reminded him of his own dad, ""except Steven doesn't wear glasses all the time.""

Yeun isn't sure where ""Minari"" falls in the realm of Asian immigrant narratives onscreen when compared to sitcoms like ""Fresh Off the Boat"" or ""Kim's Convenience.""

But he does know that the film isn't trying to tell the quintessential Asian American narrative. ""Minari"" is the story of one family, fighting for a slice of the American dream, who just happen to be Korean American, with all their pitfalls and triumphs.

""We talked a lot about making sure that we defined ourselves, that we weren't juxtaposing ourselves to a white gaze or to a majority gaze,"" Yeun said. ""We were just professing the eternal truth of this family in and of itself and actually accessing its humanity.""

That's why, aside from some white side characters, the core cast members are Korean and Korean Americans. And that's why the film is primarily in Korean, because most immigrants and first-generation families still speak a different language at home. There's no explanation for it in the film; it just is.

""I feel like in honoring the humanity of my parents and their generation, I've ended up becoming a little bit more free and full, in and of myself,"" Yeun said. ""I'm not trying to define myself through these, like, limits of shame or all these things. But rather, I am what I am. And that's totally cool.""

12,"['Minyvonne Burke', 'Minyvonne Burke Is A Breaking News Reporter For Nbc News.']","The governor of Alabama said she will extend the state's current mask mandate through April 9, and then lift the order.

Gov. Kay Ivey said Thursday that the extension is to allow businesses time to implement their own policies and make any necessary adjustments prior to the deadline.

Under the current order, masks are required in public whenever someone is within 6 feet of another individual from a different household. Face coverings are also required in schools and colleges for both employees and students in second grade and above.

But once the order ends on April 9, masks will no longer be mandated.

Ivey's announcement comes days after the governors of Texas and Mississippi announced that they would be lifting their states' mask mandates and rolling back many of their Covid-19 health requirements.

13,['Lucy Bayly Is The Business Editor For Nbc News.'],"Around 745,000 people filed for unemployment benefits for the first time last week, underscoring how the labor market continues to be hammered by the pandemic and by restrictive measures to control spread of the coronavirus.

Economists had predicted the latest weekly initial jobless claims for the week ended Feb. 26 would total around 750,000. It's the 50th week in a row that total initial claims have been higher than the worst week of the Great Recession.

As they work on rebuilding the economy, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have both stressed that ""nothing is more important"" than widespread vaccination. With 1 in 10 Americans now fully vaccinated, there are already signs that vaccination is having its intended effect, according to economists' surveys.

“The disproportionately large declines in cases and Covid-19 fatalities among residents of long-term care facilities, where 4.6 million residents and staff members have already been vaccinated, suggests that vaccinations are having significant real world benefits,” said Daan Struyven, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, in a report this week.

President Joe Biden said Tuesday the United States will have enough vaccines for every adult by the end of May, two months earlier than the administration had previously estimated, partly due to an agreement between Johnson & Johnson and Merck, who will assist with production.

For now, the pain of joblessness drags on. One year after the pandemic began, some 10 million Americans remain without work and a further 7 million have abandoned their search for work.

""This suggests it will take some time to re-employ all of these millions of Americans either unemployed or underemployed or have exited the workforce,"" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.

""Springtime for the economy appears to beckon in the months to follow, as more vaccinations are given, and many activities previously taken for granted eventually resume,"" Hamrick said. ""It is with that backdrop that consumers will feel freer to spend, including after possible passage of further federal stimulus legislation and $1,400 payments for many households.""

The closely watched monthly employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is released on Friday, and is expected to show 210,000 jobs were added to the economy last month. January gained just 49,000 positions, in part because holiday gatherings led to an increase in coronavirus infections and more business restrictions.

On Wednesday, monthly jobs data from private payroll firm ADP showed the number of hirings rose less than expected, with just 117,000 jobs versus estimates of 205,000.","['vaccinated', 'week', 'vs', 'claims', '750000', '745000', 'jobless', 'million', 'expected', 'work', 'weekly', 'americans', 'vaccinations', 'jobs', 'vaccination', 'total', 'economy']",2021-03-04 13:33:00+00:00
14,"['Dareh Gregorian', 'Dareh Gregorian Is A Politics Reporter For Nbc News.']","For decades, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has maintained an iron grip on his public image, bolstered by the unflappable loyalty of longtime allies and the trepidation of his biggest political foes.

Wanting to show that he was in control of the coronavirus pandemic, he held daily news conferences that made him nationally famous in contrast to a floundering federal response. He wanted to show that he was in control of the state's biggest city, and he spent years belittling New York City's mayor to prove it. He even wrote a book touting his ""leadership lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic"" while case numbers were still climbing.

And on Wednesday, facing his worst political crisis, he tried to give the perception that he was in control of very serious allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior, even though it was far from clear that he really was.

He publicly apologized to the women who said he sexually harassed them while letting those who've been calling for his ouster know he's not planning on going anywhere.

""I'm not going to resign,"" he said at a news conference, his first public appearance since the allegations came out. The state, he said, needs him to be in charge.

""We have a full plate. We have Covid. We have recovery. We have rebuilding. We have a teetering New York City. We have a terrible financial picture. We have to do vaccines. So no, I'm going to do the job that people of the state elected me to do,"" he said.

Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran New York political strategist, said Cuomo's remarks Wednesday were designed to let his rivals know that he's still ""in control.""

""The message was to de Blasio and to his enemies overall — I'm not going easy, and time is on my side,"" Sheinkopf said, referring to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

Cuomo, who is in his third term, has faced heat before, but nothing like the storm of controversies that have buffeted him in the past several weeks, which have prompted calls for his resignation from over a dozen Democratic state lawmakers, strong rebukes from even his closest allies and news that state legislative leaders would be stripping his emergency coronavirus powers.

Rebecca Katz, a progressive strategist who has worked for de Blasio and worked on actress Cynthia Nixon's 2018 run against the governor, said: ""Andrew Cuomo's never been under this kind of scrutiny. This is the first time his scandals are leading the news,"" which he's likely to be well aware of.

""Nobody follows Andrew Cuomo's press coverage more closely than Andrew Cuomo,"" Katz said.

Steven Greenberg, a pollster at Siena College, said, ""It's no understatement to say he's facing his toughest test as governor.""

His problems began in late January, when state Attorney General Letitia James' office issued a report that found that the state Health Department had underreported the Covid-19 death toll in nursing homes by as much as 50 percent. A top aide told Democratic legislators that Cuomo's administration took months to release data about the death toll among nursing home residents in part because of worries that the information was ""going to be used against us"" by the Trump administration.

Cuomo was then accused in mid-February of having threatened to ""destroy"" a Democratic lawmaker who had alleged that the administration ""covered up"" the numbers. Cuomo denied having threatened the outspoken Assembly member, Ron Kim, who was also calling for Cuomo's emergency pandemic powers to be revoked. Cuomo denied that there had been a cover-up, but he said the state should have moved more quickly to release information.

Over the past week, Cuomo has also been hit with allegations of sexual harassment by three women — two who had worked for his administration and one who said he had harassed her at a wedding.

The first woman, Lindsey Boylan, wrote in an essay on Medium that Cuomo had repeatedly made inappropriate comments, including one suggesting that they play strip poker, and that he had once given her an unwanted kiss on the lips. Cuomo's press secretary, Caitlin Girouard, called the allegations ""quite simply false.""

Another former aide, Charlotte Bennett, told The New York Times in an interview published Saturday that Cuomo had made several inappropriate remarks about her sex life, which she said she interpreted as an overture. Bennett, 25, has told NBC News that the Times report was accurate and declined to comment further.

Cuomo on Saturday denied having made advances to Bennett, but he acknowledged Wednesday: ""I acted in a way that made people feel uncomfortable. It was unintentional. And I truly and deeply apologize for it.

""I feel awful about it,"" he added. ""And frankly, I am embarrassed by it. And that's not easy to say. But that's the truth. But this is what I want you to know, and I want you to know this from me directly: I never touched anyone inappropriately.""

Another woman, Anna Ruch, 33, told The Times in an article published Monday that she felt ""uncomfortable and embarrassed"" when Cuomo, whom she had just met, placed his hands on her face and asked to kiss her at a wedding in 2019. The story included a photograph that appears to show the moment.

Cuomo said Wednesday: ""I didn't know I was making her uncomfortable at the time. I feel badly that I did.

""My usual custom is to kiss and to hug and make that gesture. I understand that sensitivities have changed and behavior has changed. And I get it, and I'm going to learn from it,"" he said.

That he's too friendly, however, is not the typical complaint about Cuomo.

""You reap what you sow. This is someone who's governed through fear and bullying — it works until it doesn't,"" political consultant Bradley Tusk said. ""When you stumble, the knives come out.""

The bad press has taken a toll on Cuomo's approval ratings, which hit record highs during the early months of the pandemic, when viewers flocked to watch his calm and measured coronavirus briefings. A poll by Nexstar New York/Emerson College released Tuesday indicated that only 38 percent of New Yorkers approve of the job he's doing, while 48 percent disapprove.

Tusk said it's unclear at this point whether Cuomo will still try to accomplish what his late father, Gov. Mario Cuomo, couldn't — get elected to a fourth term.

""A week and a half ago, some would have been scared to run against him,"" Tusk said.

Sheinkopf said the attorney general's investigation could work to Cuomo's advantage in the short run, because it buys him time. The investigation is expected to last months, allowing Cuomo to focus on the coronavirus vaccine rollout and coming budget talks to rebuild his managerial image.

But the week leading up to Prince Harry and Meghan's interview with the media mogul Oprah Winfrey has instead delivered daily episodes of royal drama in the shape of leaks, counterstatements and well-timed preview clips.

The latest saw Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, accuse the royal family of ""perpetuating falsehoods"" about the couple in a 30-second excerpt from the hotly-anticipated interview that was released early Thursday.

""I don’t know how they could expect that after all of this time, we would still just be silent if there’s an active role that 'The Firm' is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us,"" she tells Winfrey.

Buckingham Palace told NBC News it would not be commenting on the clip.

Using the name that the British royal family sometimes uses to describe itself, Meghan once again set the couple apart in comments that will likely further fuel the growing public rift.

The clip was released just hours after the palace said it would conduct an internal investigation into bullying allegations against Meghan that were published by a U.K. newspaper earlier this week.

""We are clearly very concerned about the allegations,"" the statement said, referring to the report in the Times newspaper, which quotes unnamed sources and contains details not independently verified by NBC News.

“The Duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character,"" a spokesperson for Meghan and Harry said.

News of the bullying probe dominated front pages in the United Kingdom on Thursday, with headlines declaring ""all-out war at the palace"" and ""unhappy families.""

Local morning shows on radio and television were similarly dominated by the royal saga.

One popular radio station went so far as to pose the question of whether the couple should be allowed to remain British citizens.

Harry and Meghan have made their issues with U.K. tabloids well-known over the past few years.

In an interview with the TV host James Corden last week, Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, said that Britain’s ""toxic"" press was one of the things that drove him to move his family to California last year to live a more independent life.

""It was a really difficult environment, as I think a lot of people saw. We all know what the British press can be like and it was destroying my mental health,"" he said.

The sprinkling of preview clips throughout the week may have been designed to build tension ahead of the interview, which is set to air on CBS on Sunday night.

And so they did.

But for a royal family accustomed to keeping matters private, the extraordinary public battle marks a notable break from tradition.

""The Sussexes appear to be going public about their experiences in an effort to take control of the narrative,"" Carolyn Harris, a royal expert and author based in Canada, said.

While royals have given many interviews before, she said, the decision to invite such public scrutiny on the tensions that have played out behind palace doors will have been ""controversial"" with the family.

""I think it's got to the point now where you can see that the gloves are off,"" Roya Nikkhah, a royal expert and Sunday Times correspondent, told BBC Radio on Thursday.

""There is so much ill will on both sides historically about what has happened that timing is just one small thing,"" she added.

The Sussexes finalized their split from the royal family last month a year after ""stepping back"" from public duties amid a tabloid onslaught, which Meghan's supporters say often veered into racist harassment and bullying.

The couple announced on Valentine's Day they were expecting their second child.

The Winfrey interview has been billed as an opportunity for the couple to speak candidly about their reasons for breaking from the family.

16,[],"The third time appeared to be the charm for Elon Musk’s Starship rocket - until it wasn’t.

The latest heavy-duty launch vehicle prototype from SpaceX soared flawlessly into the sky in a high-altitude test blast-off on Wednesday from Boca Chica, Texas, then flew itself back to Earth to achieve the first upright landing for a Starship model.

But the triumph was short-lived. Listing slightly to one side as an automated fire-suppression system trained a stream of water on flames still burning at the base of the rocket, the spacecraft blew itself to pieces about eight minutes after touchdown.

It was the third such landing attempt to end in a fireball after an otherwise successful test flight for the Starship, being developed by SpaceX to carry humans and 100 tons of cargo on future missions to the moon and Mars.

For Musk, the billionaire SpaceX founder who also heads the electric carmaker Tesla, the outcome was mixed news.

The Starship SN10 came far closer to achieving a safe, vertical touchdown than two previous models - SN8 in December and SN9 in February. In a tweet responding to tempered congratulations from an admirer of his work, Musk replied, “RIP SN10, honorable discharge.”

The video feed provided by SpaceX on the company’s YouTube channel cut off moments after the landing. But separate fan feeds streamed over the same social media platform showed an explosion suddenly erupting at the base of the rocket, hurling the SN10 into the air before it crashed to the ground and became engulfed in flames.

The complete Starship rocket, which will stand 394-feet (120 metres) tall when mated with its super-heavy first-stage booster, is SpaceX’s next-generation fully reusable launch vehicle - the center of Musk’s ambitions to make human space travel more affordable and routine.

A first orbital Starship flight is planned for year’s end.

17,"['Wilson Wong', 'Wilson Wong Is A Breaking News Reporter With Nbc News.']","Chris Harrison, host of ABC's reality dating show ""The Bachelor,"" said Thursday that he ""made a mistake"" when he defended a current contestant's past racist behavior.

In an interview with ABC News' ""Good Morning America,"" Harrison addressed his comments defending ""Bachelor"" contestant Rachael Kirkconnell, whose old photos showed her attending an antebellum plantation-themed fraternity formal in 2018. She was also accused of liking a photo containing the Confederate flag.

""I am an imperfect man, I made a mistake and I own that,"" Harrison told ""GMA"" co-host Michael Strahan. ""I believe that mistake doesn't reflect who I am or what I stand for. I am committed to progress, not just for myself, also for the franchise.""

Harrison was embroiled in controversy last month after an interview on ""Extra"" with former ""Bachelorette"" Rachel Lindsay, where he appeared to defend Kirkconnell. Days after the interview, Harrison announced that he was ""stepping aside"" from his hosting duties for ""a period of time.""

In his interview with Lindsay, Harrison expressed sympathy for Kirkconnell and implied that the criticism directed against her was unfair because the photos were from the past. When Lindsay said it was not a good look that Kirkconnell had attended a party celebrating the antebellum South, Harrison said, “Well, Rachel, is it a good look in 2018? Or is it not a good look in 2021? Because there’s a big difference.”

""It's not a good look ever,"" Lindsay said in response. ""If I went to that party, what would I represent at that party?""

In his interview with Strahan, Harrison renounced his previous statements, saying that antebellum parties — which celebrate a time period in the South during which slavery was present — were not OK in the ""past, present, future.""

Lindsay deactivated her Instagram account after becoming the target of online harassment over her interview with Harrison.

Harrison pleaded with people to stop harassing Lindsay.

""I stand against all forms of racism, and I am deeply sorry to Rachel Lindsay and to the Black community,"" Harrison said. ""To anyone who is throwing hate towards Rachel Lindsay, please stop.""

As for his return to ""The Bachelor"" series, Harrison said he hoped to come back with a renewed sense of change.

""This franchise can be an important beacon of change,"" he said. ""I know that change is felt, not just by me, but by many others. And we are excited and willing to do the work to show that progress.""

In the meantime, Harrison said he was seeking guidance from a ""race educator and strategist,"" who is teaching him how to learn from this experience and move forward.

He added that his ""GMA"" interview was ""not the finish line.""

18,['The Associated Press'],"Legislators in more than 20 states have introduced bills this year that would ban transgender girls from competing on girls’ sports teams in public high schools. Yet in almost every case, sponsors cannot cite a single instance in their own state or region where such participation has caused problems.

The Associated Press reached out to two dozen state lawmakers sponsoring such measures around the country as well as the conservative groups supporting them and found only a few times it’s been an issue among the hundreds of thousands of American teenagers who play high school sports.

In South Carolina, for example, Rep. Ashley Trantham said she knew of no transgender athletes competing in the state and was proposing a ban to prevent possible problems in the future. Otherwise, she said during a recent hearing, “the next generation of female athletes in South Carolina may not have a chance to excel.""

In Tennessee, House Speaker Cameron Sexton conceded there may not actually be transgender students now participating in middle and high school sports; he said a bill was necessary so the state could be “proactive.”

Some lawmakers didn't respond to AP's queries. Others in places like Mississippi and Montana largely brushed aside the question or pointed to a pair of runners in Connecticut. Between 2017 and 2019, transgender sprinters Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood combined to win 15 championship races, prompting a lawsuit.

Supporters of transgender rights say the Connecticut case gets so much attention from conservatives because it’s the only example of its kind.

“It’s their Exhibit A, and there’s no Exhibit B — absolutely none,” said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights and a prominent trans-rights attorney.

The multiple sports bills, he says, address a threat that doesn’t exist.

There’s no authoritative count of how many trans athletes have competed recently in high school or college sports. Neither the NCAA nor most state high school athletic associations collect that data; in the states that do collect it, the numbers are minimal: No more than five students currently in Kansas, nine in Ohio over five years.

Transgender adults make up a small portion of the U.S. population, about 1.3 million as of 2016, according to the Williams Institute, a think tank at the UCLA School of Law that specializes in research on LGBTQ issues.

The two dozen bills making their way through state legislatures this year could be devastating for transgender teens who usually get little attention as they compete.

In Utah, a 12-year-old transgender girl cried when she heard about the proposal, which would separate her from her friends. She’s far from the tallest girl on her club team and has worked hard to improve her times but is not a dominant swimmer in her age group, her coach said.

“Other than body parts, I’ve been a girl my whole life,” she said.

The girl and her family spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to avoid outing her publicly.

Those who object to the growing visibility and rights for transgender people, though, argue new laws are needed to keep the playing field fair for cisgender girls.

“When the law does not recognize differences between men and women, we’ve seen that women lose,” said Christiana Holcomb, an attorney for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which filed the Connecticut lawsuit on behalf of four cisgender girls.

One of those girls, Chelsea Mitchell, defeated Terry Miller — the faster of the two trans sprinters — in their final two races in February 2020.

The ADF and others like it are the behind-the-scenes backers of the campaign, offering model legislation and a playbook to promote the bills, most of them with common features and even titles, like the Save Women’s Sports Act.

When asked for other examples of complaints about middle or high school transgender athletes, ADF and the Family Policy Alliance, cited two: One involved a Hawaii woman who coaches track and filed a complaint last year over a trans girl competing in girls’ volleyball and track. The other involved a cisgender girl in Alaska who defeated a trans sprinter in 2016, then appeared in a Family Policy Alliance video saying the trans girl’s third-place finish was unfair to runners who were further behind.

Only one state, Idaho, has enacted a law curtailing trans students’ sports participation, and that 2020 measure is blocked by a court ruling.

Chase Strangio, a transgender-rights attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, notes that in several states with proposed sports bans, lawmakers also are seeking to ban certain gender affirming health care for transgender young people.

“This is not about sports,” he said. “It’s a way to attack trans people.”

Some states' school athletic organizations already have rules about trans participation in sports: 19 states allow full inclusion of trans athletes; 16 have no clear-cut statewide policy; seven emulate the NCAA's rule by requiring hormone therapy for trans girls; and eight effectively ban trans girls from girls’ teams, according to attorney Asaf Orr of the National Center for Lesbian Rights.

Texas is among those with a ban, limiting transgender athletes to teams conforming with the gender on their birth certificate.

That policy came under criticism in 2017 and 2018, when trans male Mack Beggs won state titles in girls’ wrestling competitions after he was told he could not compete as a boy.

While Beggs, Miller and Yearwood were the focus of news coverage and controversy, trans athletes more commonly compete without any furor — and with broad acceptance from teammates and competitors.

In New Jersey’s Camden County, trans 14-year-old Rebekah Bruesehoff competes on her middle school field hockey team and hopes to keep playing in high school.

""It’s all been positive,” she said. “The coaches have been really helpful.”

While New Jersey has a trans-inclusive sports policy, Rebekah is distressed by the proposed bans elsewhere — notably measures that might require girls to verify their gender.

“I know what it’s like to have my gender questioned,” Rebekah said. “It’s invasive, embarrassing. I don’t want others to go through that.”

The possibility that any athlete could have to undergo tests or examinations to prove their gender was among the reasons that Truman Hamburger, a 17-year-old high school student in North Dakota, showed up at the statehouse to protest a proposed ban.

“Once you open up that door on gender policing, that’s not a door you can easily shut,” he said.

Sarah Huckman, a 20-year-old sophomore at the University of New Hampshire, ran track and cross country for three years at Kingswood Regional High School in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, after coming out as trans in seventh grade.

Huckman showed great talent in the sprints and hurdles but was not dominant on a statewide level. In her senior year, she won several events in small and mid-size meets, and had sixth place and 10th place finishes in the Division II indoor state championships.

The proposed bans appall her.

“It’s so demeaning toward my group of people,” she said. “We’re all human beings. We do sports for the love of it.”

He died Wednesday at 5:35 p.m. local time, Pine Bluff police Sgt. Richard Wegner told NBC News.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends,"" the school district said in a post on its Facebook page.

According to police, another 15-year-old shot Burnett at 9:59 a.m. local time in a hallway outside Watson Chapel Junior High School's main office. Authorities are not identifying him because of his age. While the department has not revealed a motive in the shooting, DeFoor said the incident was ""targeted.""

Monday was the first day back to in-person classes for Watson Chapel students after days of remote learning due to a water issue. Students at the junior high school went back to remote learning Tuesday and Wednesday due to the shooting. They were scheduled to return to in-person classes on Thursday.

""It is imperative that all students take advantage of the many, many professionals who will be present to provide counseling and guidance to our students as they return to school,"" the district said in a statement.

On Wednesday, a judge set the suspect's bond at $1 million.

He was being held in Jefferson County’s juvenile detention center on a charge of first-degree battery. A homicide charge has not been filed. His next hearing is set for April 12.

The organization announced this week that it is replacing its cheerleading squad, known as the ""First Ladies of Football,"" with a coed dance team. The program was paused last month while officials worked on rebranding it.

“As we set out to modernize the Washington Football gameday, it's important that we develop a top-notch entertainment program that keeps our fanbase excited and connected to the game and the team,” Washington Football Team president Jason Wright said in a statement.

The shift to a coed dance team is the latest in a series of changes for the NFL franchise. Last year, the team's old name, long condemned as an anti-Indigenous slur, was retired.

Wright said he expects a new, permanent name to replace Washington Football Team in 2022.

This week's announcement also comes after the organization reached a settlement with a group of former cheerleaders who appeared in lewd videos allegedly shown to team executives in 2008 and 2010, NBC Washington reported. It is awaiting the results of an NFL investigation into sexual harassment and misconduct accusations across the organization, according to the station.

Petra Pope, a 33-year NBA veteran who managed the Laker Girls and launched the Knicks City Dancers, was hired Wednesday to oversee the Washington Football Team's revamped entertainment experience. She will select and train new personnel and develop new choreography that emphasizes athleticism and dance for the team’s first “gender-neutral and diverse” squad.

Philip, 99, was first admitted to a London hospital last month after feeling unwell. The palace later confirmed he had an infection, and he was transferred to another hospital Monday to continue treatment and undergo tests on the heart condition.

""The Duke of Edinburgh yesterday underwent a successful procedure for a pre-existing heart condition at St Bartholomew’s Hospital,"" the palace said in a statement early Thursday. ""His Royal Highness will remain in hospital for treatment, rest and recuperation for a number of days.""

The palace had previously said he was expected to stay in the hospital until at least the end of the week.

St. Bartholomew's Hospital, which is run by the publicly-funded National Health Service, says it has Europe’s largest specialized cardiovascular service.

The queen and Philip both received their Covid-19 vaccinations in January.

During the coronavirus pandemic, the royal couple have been staying at Windsor Castle, around 30 miles west of London. The United Kingdom has the highest death toll in Europe.

Philip retired from public duties in 2017, and is the longest-serving royal consort in British history. He turns 100 in June.

In April, he released a written statement praising those involved in the fight against the coronavirus.

Philip and the queen celebrated their 73rd anniversary in November. Together, they have four children — Prince Charles, born in 1948; Princess Anne, born in 1950; Prince Andrew, born in 1960; and Prince Edward, born in 1964 — along with dozens of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

The date has somewhat bizarre significance to conspiracy theorists like followers of the ""sovereign citizen"" movement and QAnon. The fact that men and women with sophisticated military skills might buy into such theories is alarming. A small number of skilled and motivated extremists could do outsize damage.

We already know that plenty of far-right extremists see themselves as ""soldiers.""

We already know that plenty of far-right extremists see themselves as ""soldiers."" Several right-wing nationalist groups played a disproportionate role in the Jan. 6 attack on America's Capitol. These groups carefully planned their efforts, co-opting the language, the look and even the tactics of the military. But it is more than play-acting. According to multiple reports, we also know that a significant number of those involved in the attack have real ties to the military. Some Americans seemed shocked by this fact; they should not have been.

The number of right-wing nationalist groups that have been identified in the United States has increased dramatically over the past decade, a fact FBI Director Christopher Wray confirmed during his Senate testimony this week. Consequently, it is not surprising that their members include veterans, active-duty personnel and members of the National Guard or the reserves. The Defense Department also acknowledged this fact in a report released Tuesday.

Whether timed to March 4 or not, the growth of right-wing groups and their ability to infiltrate the military is unquestionably a significant threat. Clearly Americans are alarmed. In a poll conducted by the Anti-Defamation League after the attack on the Capitol, over 75 percent of respondents expressed serious concerns about widespread violence in the next year by white supremacist groups or anti-government militias.

Some of these groups have actively encouraged their members to join the military or sought to recruit veterans. They not surprisingly view the unique training the military offers in weapons, communications and cyber as an exploitable asset. One expert observed that military members could ""dramatically escalate the impact of fringe activism, pass on explosives expertise or urban warfare expertise."" The presence of military personnel or veterans also gives militia groups a degree of political legitimacy and public credibility.

Obviously, this dynamic also threatens to further undermine America's faith in its military, and it is damaging to vital civil-military relations. But the participation of active-duty service members, National Guard members or reservists in such groups is not simply contrary to ""good order and discipline"" in the ranks. Forty percent of the men and women in uniform today are people of color. As Dov Zakheim wrote in The Hill in January, ""eliminating from the ranks racial, ethnic and religious hatred and the White supremacists who stoke it is not a 'nice to have.' It is critical if America is to win its wars.""

Shortly after his confirmation, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sought to confront the issue with the full support of all of the uniformed service chiefs and civilian secretaries. He directed a thorough review of all department policies on extremist activity and a study to ascertain the depth of the problem. Some experts in domestic terrorism and law enforcement have estimated that veterans and current members of the military may now make up at least 25 percent of militia rosters in the U.S. The same analysis suggests that there could be 20,000 active militia members in around 300 groups. The comprehensive studies that previously examined the question of military members' participation in extremist organizations are over two decades old.

Austin also ordered all commanders to conduct a leadership ""stand-down"" for their units by the end of March. In the military, stand-downs are used to focus the attention of the entire force on a serious issue. This is a problem of culture and values. All service members swear an oath at enlistment and at promotion to ""support and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic."" Consequently, these discussions must focus on the meaning of that oath, impermissible behavior and each individual's responsibility to report activities to the contrary.

One of the challenges is that, unlike with international terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, membership in extremist organizations is not illegal. Nor is it always stigmatized. There is evidence that some military personnel are very open about membership. Pentagon regulations do forbid service members from active ""participation"" in organizations that advance supremacist or extremist ideology. This includes involvement in groups that advocate illegal discrimination or racism or seek to deprive people of their civil rights. There have, however, been suggestions to update this guidance — which was written in 2012.

One of the challenges is that, unlike with international terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, membership in extremist organizations is not illegal.

Legislation has also been proposed to change the Uniform Code of Military Justice to address ""extremist activity."" Even with such changes, legislation that would provide greater clarity and criminalize certain actions or membership in specific organizations is unlikely because of civil liberties concerns.

The stand-down will also remind all military commanders of actions they can take against members of their units involved with extremist groups. These include counseling, removal from certain duties, denial of security clearances, bars to re-enlistment and even courts-martial. Military leaders should be also required to familiarize themselves with relevant external signs, like flags, patches or tattoos, associated with such groups, to enhance overall awareness.

Still, no one in the Defense Department expects the stand-down to be a panacea. Dealing with this challenge effectively will require much closer coordination between the Pentagon and the FBI. Commanders of major military bases and National Guard units must also expand contact with local and state law enforcement agencies, particularly in those parts of the country where such groups are prevalent and active.

Screening potential recruits, as well as monitoring those now serving, must also be a focus. And this will present significant logistical and legal challenges.

Currently, screening people before they join the military includes looking for extremist, racist or gang-related tattoos, as well as checking people against local and federal criminal databases. Any increased screening of potential recruits must consider that the military (particularly the active Army, the National Guard and the reserves) is already confronting the most difficult recruiting environment since the advent of the all-volunteer force almost 50 years ago. Expanded reviews and requirements for enlistment will inevitably complicate the challenge recruiters face to meet enlistment quotas without significant additional resources. This may even discourage them from digging deeply into the backgrounds of potential recruits who are otherwise qualified.

Vetting social media for recruits, as well as monitoring the current force, is clearly a monumental task that may also have legal implications. Recruits do provide consent for obtaining publicly available social media when they submit applications for mandatory personnel screens. But subsequent reviews raise important freedom-of-speech questions. As an Air Force legal opinion in 2013 observed, ""The bottom line is that the right to free speech is an important one, and restrictions of servicemembers' speech rights should not be undertaken without carefully balancing those rights against identifiable and important military interests.""

The Defense Department has begun an effort to examine social media and has sought to incorporate FBI resources to help better identify and screen anyone who advocates domestic terrorism. But there are major challenges, such as getting access to the encrypted platforms often used by extremist organizations, as well as obtaining the legal authority to collect private discussions.

In the long term, senior civilian and military leaders must continue to emphasize the threat right-wing extremism poses to military values and overall operational effectiveness — not to mention America. Combatting this threat must become an essential part of entry-level training, as well as officer/non-commissioned officer education and development. It should be a topic of thorough discussion at basic training, non-commissioned officer academies and military academies, in the Reserve Officer Training Core, at senior service colleges, etc.

The challenge of dealing with the veterans community may be the most intractable part of the problem. It will require greater efforts by both the Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs to assist veterans during community reintegration. Many veterans voice a desire for the sense of belonging, brotherhood and patriotism offered by the military, and especially during deployments. These desires, coupled with anti-government sentiment, can motivate right-wing recruitment. Greater cooperation and outreach by veterans groups could be useful in providing purpose and positive social relationships for those leaving military service.

Finally, the military services may need to revisit their cultures and the importance of military values and oaths — both for those actively serving and for veterans. As one young Marine observed after the Jan. 6 attack, ""I wonder if there's a way for the Marine Corps to craft a more vivid narrative about what it means to be a Marine after you've hung (the uniform) up.""

Ending right-wing extremism in the military will not be accomplished by a one-day stand-down, a closer examination of tattoos or reviews of recruits' Twitter accounts. It will require a sustained effort by both the uniformed and civilian leadership of the Defense Department in concert with other federal agencies. As Austin observed during his Senate confirmation hearing, ""The job of the Department of Defense is to keep America safe from our enemies, but we can't do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks.""

In his new job, Austin is confronted by enormous challenges abroad — the Afghan war, nuclear proliferation and threats from North Korea, Iran, China and Russia. But removing the cancer of right-wing extremism from the military ranks could be his greatest service to our democracy, and his ultimate legacy.","['department', 'dangers', 'recruits', 'groups', 'military', 'extremist', 'service', 'ties', 'highlight', 'capitol', 'rumors', 'attack', 'rightwing', 'farright', 'veterans', 'defense', 'members', 'extremisms']",2021-03-04 09:34:00+00:00

He Is The Author Of']","Republicans have long declared their supposedly unwavering obeisance to the great invisible hand of the market; as former House GOP Leader Dick Armey liked to say, “Markets are smart; government is dumb.”

And yet several recent moments have made that commitment seem situational. Whether discussing Dr. Seuss, Mr. Potato Head, voting rights or Twitter, Republicans seem ill at ease with — or just ignorant of — the ways the mighty market actually functions.

Just witness the contrived hysteria about the fabricated “cancellation” of Dr. Seuss, the beloved children’s books author. Dr. Seuss Enterprises — the very profitable company which controls the estate of the late Theodor Seuss Geisel, the man behind the pen name — has decided of its own free will to stop publishing a half-dozen of his books because, the company told The Associated Press, they “portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong,” deploying stereotypes about Black and Asian people in a manner that Seuss’s own estate thinks is offensive and inappropriate.

The Fox outrage machine revved itself to high dudgeon over how this private company has decided to conduct its business, bemoaning the Seussian scalp-taking; the GOP’s culture-war ambulance chasers quickly followed suit. “First, they outlaw Dr. Seuss” — mind you, Theodore Geisel died in 1991 and its his own estate taking this action — “and now they want to tell us what to say,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said in a mendacious non sequitur while debating proposed election law reforms.

The GOP is trying to use the heavy hand of government to pick and choose who can be a consumer rather than responding to their will.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted that the spurious Seuss-squelching — again, the company that owns the rights to his work is opting not to continue publishing a handful of them moving forward — will prompt history books to see this era as “an example of a depraved sociopolitical purge driven by hysteria and lunacy.”

Someone is demonstrating hysteria and lunacy, but it's not who Rubio suggests.

Let’s get some perspective here: Seuss Enterprises made $33 million last year, more than 650 million of his books have been sold around the world and they’re available in more than 100 countries. There is no significant move — and certainly not from Seuss Enterprises — to ban, burn or otherwise cancel Dr. Seuss. A private company has made a considered business decision by pulling a small fraction of the Seuss catalog (none among its top sellers).

Exactly why is this any of the business of the federal government? Surely Republicans, who supposedly believe the government should interfere in private business decisions as little as possible, don’t think the market should cease to work its infallible will; surely if Seuss Enterprises is erring and catering to a political correctness that nobody wants, market forces will correct it. (Of course, the right-wing cancel chorus isn’t holding its breath for that to happen; neither should you. Most people weren’t buying these particular books in the first place.)

Or take the tale of Mr. Potato Head, the brand of children’s toy under which both Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head dolls have long been marketed by Hasbro. Last week, Hasbro announced that this entire universe of toys will henceforth be marketed under the brand “Potato Head” — though the titular couple will still be “Mr.” and “Mrs.” — and conservatives lost their collective minds, including some on Capitol Hill, where some Republicans weren’t going to let facts get in the way of their feelings.

The right’s growing disillusionment with free markets might have to do with the markets’ drift away from the right.

Glenn Beck assessed the true import of the Seuss/Potato Head decisions in typically florid fashion: “Buy Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head because it's the end of an era,” he said Wednesday. “It is the end of freedom in America.”

But, again: If Hasbro thinks it makes more sense to sell a Mrs. Potato Head doll as part of a “Potato Head” brand, rather than a “Mr. Potato Head” brand — and it does — isn’t that a company’s right? And if the company’s wrong, the market will tell them, with no right-wing outrage machine trying to cancel their decision necessary.

So what’s going on?

Perhaps looking to voting rights can help sharpen the picture. In a Supreme Court hearing on Tuesday over whether a restrictive Arizona law unconstitutionally discriminates against minorities, Republican National Committee lawyer Michael Carvin told the court that striking down the law — making it easier to vote — would put the GOP “at a competitive disadvantage relative to Democrats.”

It was a startling if not surprising admission. Republicans have lost the presidential popular vote in seven of the last eight elections — or to put it another way, they have been losing political market share. But instead of adjusting their product (their candidates and policies) or how they sell it (their messaging), the GOP increasingly relies on government interference to maintain power, including the distortionary nature of the Electoral College and the U.S. Senate (which is evenly split despite the fact that Democrats represent 41 million more constituents), radical gerrymandering and restrictive voting laws, like Arizona’s.

Conservatives may not like which market forces companies respond to, but in a free market, that's not their call.

But it’s not just anti-democratic (or anti-Republican) to try to reduce the system’s responsiveness to the will of the people; it’s anti-market. The GOP is, in effect, trying to use the heavy hand of government to pick and choose who can be a consumer rather than responding to their will.

In other words, the right’s growing disillusionment with free markets might have to do with the markets’ drift away from the right.

Companies are taking a more holistic view of what factors drive their decisions. For instance, the Business Roundtable — hardly a bastion of AOC stans and Bernie bros — announced in 2019 that the purpose of a corporation extended beyond strict adherence to the bottom line and includes “all stakeholders — customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.”

Conservatives may not like which market forces companies respond to, but in a free market, that's not their call. But in a less free market, they believe, maybe it could be.

Which brings us to former president Donald Trump. Speaking to the Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend, he repeated his oft-made claim that social media is part of a giant conspiracy to censor and silence conservatives. “Republicans, conservatives must … repeal Section 230 liability protections,” Trump told the crowd, to extended cheers. (Section 230 actually protects internet companies from liability from lawsuits for what gets published by others on their platforms, not from what they remove; ending it would, ironically, result in more content being removed, not less.)

“And if the federal government refuses to act,” he said, “then every state in the union where we have the votes, which is a lot of them, Big Tech giants, like Twitter, Google and Facebook, should be punished with major sanctions whenever they silence conservative voices.”

Never mind that Facebook has long catered to conservatives or that it wasn’t conservatism that got Trump a lifetime Twitter ban but seditious, insurrectionist lies. Trump called for — and conservatives cheered — more regulation of and lawsuits against private companies based on their market-based business decisions, and for the limited-government party to unleash the power of federal and state governments to punish those companies for how they choose to conduct their businesses.

In a free market in which Twitter was making bad business decisions, users would punish it by switching to Parler or Gab. Most, of course, have not done that; the idea that most users want more abuse, more violent rhetoric or more conspiracy theories proliferating on their social platforms is absurd. So conservatives want to find a way for the government to force companies to feed it to us anyway.

In the end the biggest victim of cancel culture might just be conservative principles.","['war', 'free', 'seuss', 'business', 'fight', 'debate', 'republicans', 'head', 'mr', 'conservatives', 'market', 'cancel', 'companies', 'shows', 'potato', 'culture']",2021-03-03 20:20:00+00:00

Find Him On Twitter']","In 2016, Donald Trump stood alone in advocating his particular brand of nativism, bigotry and screw-your-feelings Twitter hot takes. Now that Trumpism has become the norm within the GOP, voters seem to be asking why they would again nominate a nationally unpopular standard-bearer instead of one of Trump’s more dynamic acolytes. Indeed, if this weekend’s Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, made anything clear, it’s that Donald Trump may not last long as the standard-bearer of Trumpism.

The fracturing MAGA base is big trouble for the former president — and an opportunity for Trump proteges like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

An overwhelming 95 percent of GOP activists at the event want a strong Trump-inspired national agenda going forward, according to a Washington Times/CPAC poll released during the event. And while CPAC attendees may represent an extreme fringe of the GOP, that fringe tracks with the broader party mood. A Morning Consult/Politico poll released just after Trump was acquitted in his second impeachment trial found 59 percent of Republicans still wanted him to play a “major role” in the GOP going forward.

But while the CPAC straw poll showed that Trump remains the first choice of these die-hard Republican activists, the margin should be way too narrow for the former president’s comfort. A full third of those polled (32 percent) said they didn’t think Trump should run for president in 2024 or were unsure that he should.

The fracturing MAGA base is big trouble for the former president — and an opportunity for Trump proteges like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Trump received 55 percent of the straw poll vote to the governor’s second-place 21. Without Trump as an option, DeSantis won a dominant plurality of 43 percent.

Though there would have been no Trumpism without Trump, Republicans’ hesitation highlights the fact that Trumpism can go forward without him — and maybe would be more successful if it did, as Trumpism’s policy goals wouldn’t face the distracting circus of Trump himself.

For all of Trump’s bluster, he generally proved ineffective at creating durable policy change — with the exception of the federal bench with its lifetime appointments, though how those judges rule in any given case is far from certain. Trump himself proved so personally unpopular that the conservative mainstreaming of Trumpism couldn’t save his doomed 2020 campaign. And Trump will spend the next four years separated from the social media platforms and presidential podium that made him a constant presence in American life.

“I don’t think they believe that Trump will actually be a candidate in 2024,” Republican strategist Mac Stipanovich told The Orlando Sentinel of the candidates coming up behind him.

While Trump was almost certainly boosted by the American Conservative Union’s decision to host CPAC right on his Palm Beach doorstep — a conscious effort at a “Trump coronation,” according to former ACU chief Al Cardenas — that decision only underscored his weakness by revealing the relative strength of his would-be heirs, DeSantis in particular.

Though Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas have tried to position themselves as the presumptive heir to the MAGA movement, CPAC voters left Florida unconvinced: When Trump was excluded as an option, Cruz garnered support from only 7 percent of those polled. Hawley drew only 3 percent, on par with Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

Trump’s biggest competitor, it turns out, is much closer to Mar-a-Lago. DeSantis, who cribbed Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech in welcoming CPAC attendees to Florida’s “oasis of freedom,” also stands out as the runaway 2024 favorite among hard-line GOP voters (admittedly he was probably also boosted by local supporters at the convention).

With Trump removed from the CPAC survey, DeSantis easily lapped the field with a staggering 43 percent. His closest challenger, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, barely broke double digits, at 11 percent. The sharp rise of the DeSantis movement complicates an already difficult electoral math for Trump, who would face the real risk of losing Florida — now his adopted home state — to a governor whose approval rating far outperforms not only Trump’s, but every other GOP elected official in Florida.

While CPAC represents only one flank of the enduring Republican base, it is a crucial one. An unknown portion of rank-and-file Republican voters left the party following the Capitol attacks, and that Great Defection had the perverse effect of strengthening far-right control of the party at a critical moment. With moderates fleeing and critical voices like Sens. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Ben Sasse of Nebraska rebuked and censured by their state parties for supporting impeachment, MAGA advocates once stuck with Trump now have an overflowing buffet of ideologically aligned candidates from which to choose.

And given that his electoral defeat resulted in the former president facing an impeachment charge of inciting an insurrection, even the unrepentant Trump might have second thoughts about entering the 2024 race when candidates like DeSantis are actively transforming his movement into more concrete action. And Trump’s declining popularity indicates that what Republican voters find unpalatable is Trump himself.

DeSantis is positioned to burnish his conservative credentials in the upcoming state legislative session. A recent survey of Florida political experts — more than half of whom are Republicans and a quarter Democrats — expect DeSantis to come away from the session with big victories on red-meat GOP proposals like an anti-rioting bill targeting liberal groups like Black Lives Matter and new voter suppression legislation. With the votes to pass any legislation they want, DeSantis and Florida Republicans can credibly claim to be a more effective, less distracting version of Trump.

Trump will remain a vengeful voice within the GOP even if he forgos a third campaign for the White House. But having made their performative point in elevating Trump to the presidency in 2016, Republican voters may now want to prove that Trumpism can produce lasting policies that reshape American life. Unfortunately for a man who billed himself as a legendary dealmaker, Trump failed to enshrine his voters’ values into sweeping law, and that failure now has the movement he energized quietly weighing its options.","['voters', 'hes', 'cpac', 'gop', 'secure', 'trump', 'florida', 'trumpism', 'trumps', 'republicans', 'statue', 'desantis', 'position', 'max', 'implies', 'republican', 'isnt', 'king']",2021-03-03 17:27:00+00:00
25,"['Sakshi Venkatraman', 'Sakshi Venkatraman Writes For Nbc News.']","Anjana Rajamani was 12 years old the first time she tried to shave her face.

""This guy I had a crush on said my mustache was thicker than his in front of all my class,"" she said.

After crying in the bathroom of her Southern California middle school, she went home and shaved it off.

""I gave myself razor burn,"" said Rajamani, 22. ""I had pink marks in my mustache area for two weeks.""

For Desi women who grew up in mostly white schools, that story might be uncomfortably familiar. Young South Asians say their elementary and middle school years were characterized by a dominating feature: hair. Everywhere. Bushy unibrows, thick leg hair, upper lip fuzz and coarse locks made them feel othered — and ugly — when they were 12.

As conversations about beauty, self-love and internalized racism come to the forefront, brown women are confronting what that did to them. White society set the standard that their body hair and face hair wasn't beautiful, Desi women say. And after years of promoting plucking, shaving and threading, the beauty industry put bushy eyebrows back on trend. Exhausted by being beholden to a standard that disregards them, Desi women say they have no choice but to define beauty on their own terms.

From age 11, Sonali Krishnakumar remembers being told she had ""man legs,"" ""hairy knees,"" a mustache and bad eyebrows. The insecurities crept up in middle school, so she stopped wearing crop tops, and she wore long pants even in the summer and begged her mom to let her shave. Being hairy made her feel ""dirty,"" she said.

She recalls once spending three painstaking hours yanking out her thick leg hairs with her mom's epilator.

""Now I'm like, why did I do that to myself? Why did I put myself through that?"" said Krishnakumar, 19.

""It's one of those things you're never conscious of until a white person points it out,"" one woman said.

She has watched the standard of beauty evolve from the time she was a little girl. Back then, thin brows, straight hair and a smooth, hairless body were in fashion. She didn't fit the mold. The root of her insecurity, she said, was looking to the white girls in her class, whom she considered beautiful, and wondering why she didn't look like them.

South Asian women say the subtle comments and looks from peers growing up compounded what pop culture had ingrained into them — that they weren't beautiful. Samaa Khullar, 20, has never forgotten how biting some of the remarks were.

""I remember in middle school in the changing rooms for PE, girls would laugh about having dark underarms or dark hair,"" she said. ""You know, it's one of those things you're never conscious of until a white person points it out.""

Body hair standards as 'part of a white supremacist system'

Hair removal experts say the sentiment holds true when you look at the history of U.S. beauty standards. Hairlessness, after it became common in the 20th century, was synonymous with purity and white femininity.

""You can track patterns of anxiety about hygiene, beauty, personal care according to different migratory patterns to the U.S.,"" said Rebecca Herzig, a professor of gender and sexuality studies at Bates College in Maine and author of ""Plucked: A History of Hair Removal.""

In the late 19th century, when a wave of immigrants came to the U.S. from Southern and Eastern Europe, there was a parallel effort to medicalize and demonize excessive body hair, Herzig said. Immigrant women from those countries had different features and more body hair — and the modern beauty standard began to take shape as part of the anti-immigrant reaction. Similar personal hygiene and beauty anxieties rose when migrants came from Asia, including South Asians, in the early 20th century. The 1950s and the 1960s brought another rise in immigration from Asia and Latin America, and the popularity of hair removal shot up with it.

""You can see new anxieties about personal hygiene, personal care, personal beauty, all getting tangled up with ideas about whiteness and race more broadly,"" an expert said.

""You can see new anxieties about personal hygiene, personal care, personal beauty, all getting tangled up with ideas about whiteness and race more broadly,"" Herzig said. ""'How is whiteness going to be defined? How is it going to be maintained? Who is going to get the privileges associated with it?'""

Herzig said that in her research and interactions with South Asian women, she can see the depth of harm that has been caused.

""It's important to understand that it's part of a white supremacist system, that it's not just psychological, not just about women internalizing and being damaged from these harmful messages,"" she said. ""It's also that there's whole legal, economic and social structures supporting that psychological harm.""

She said the demonization is compounded for trans women of color who are shamed for having body hair and are often ostracized when they seek to have it removed professionally.

The mental health toll

Feeling ugly, othered and at the whim of white beauty standards takes a toll that can stick with you for a lifetime, said Yuki Yamazaki, a half-South Indian, half-Japanese psychotherapist specializing in Asian Americans and colorism.

""Within a white society, already being a South Asian is to feel other,"" she said. ""Either that's because of your name, the culture or religion you were raised in, the food that you eat. Body hair is just another.""

Feeling ostracized like that can be a trigger, Yamazaki said, and it can induce stress and anxiety in environments where you feel implicitly or overtly judged. Both U.S. and South Asian media can also contribute to those feelings.

""No one has to tell you that you're unattractive or ugly for you to feel like you're unattractive or ugly,"" she said. ""When you look on the TV, there's constantly things on how to remove body hair, how to shave, how to be smooth. Skin lightening stuff, too. The skin that you have and the stuff on top of it needs to be altered.""

Yamazaki said that it can be a lot to unpack but that a good place for people to start can be to look inward at their own body hair practices and ask: ""How is it helping? How is it making me feel better?"" With people leaving their homes much more infrequently, she said, her own South Asian friends contend with the question of how to survive without consistent hair removal.

""We have two competing societies at the very least, white society and South Asian society, that gives us all of this bias and shame,"" she said. ""We're born into these cultures. How do we want to unpack it? And how do we eventually want to move forward inside of it?""

When your 'ugly' eyebrows become a profitable trend

Herzig places eyebrows in a category of their own — eyebrow trends change with the wind, and eyebrows themselves are easy to alter. But as the early 2000s trend of razor-thin eyebrows gave way to the fluffy, bushy brows of the 2010s, Desi women find themselves playing catch-up, they say.

Khullar said she was itching for the moment her mom would let her get her brows done in eighth grade. She wanted to fit in, so she got them threaded thin like the white girls at school.

""Literally, like, probably a year and a half later, everyone's like, 'Taylor Hill's eyebrows are so beautiful, and we should be moving on to the thick eyebrow trend,'"" Khullar said. ""They're capitalizing and profiting off of our features that they told us were ugly.""

""Whatever you feel insecure about right now is going to change when white people change their opinions on it,"" one person said.

She wishes she could go back and tell her younger self to stop with the hair removal and just embrace her natural look.

""Whatever you feel insecure about right now is going to change when white people change their opinions on it,"" she said.

Sai Seshadri, 23, was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS, six years ago. It meant that her facial and body hair grew thicker even than the typical South Asian's, and she ""always had this feeling like I was being judged.""

Seshadri said that she was teased in elementary and middle school for her facial and body hair, especially by preteen boys, and that it made her hate the way she looked. The girls with ""fair skin, perfect eyebrows and blond hair"" were the pretty ones.

When she was 14, she started getting her eyebrows threaded and shaving her legs. As an adult, she looks back with sadness and says she's still working to shake the internalized racism and embrace herself. With thick eyebrows back in fashion, it frustrates her that she has to fill in her thin brow hair to get the coveted look.

""Now when it's attached to an Instagram influencer or a model, it's cool. It's amazing,"" she said. ""They make money off of it. And meanwhile, there's so many of us who are still recovering from how we felt about it when we were younger.""

She's being treated for PCOS, and she said her symptoms have greatly improved. But being a South Asian woman still means that body and facial hair is a part of her journey. In leaving her community and meeting new people, Seshadri said, she has been able to overcome some of the beauty ideals she aspired to as a child. Talking to other women of color has been an important part of her journey.

""It wasn't something with me,"" she said. ""A lot of people felt that way. We're all unlearning it together.""","['asian', 'desi', 'hair', 'feel', 'south', 'personal', 'challenging', 'white', 'racist', 'growing', 'eyebrows', 'body', 'women', 'standards', 'shamed', 'beauty']",2021-03-04 14:15:00+00:00

Breast cancer had killed Johnson’s mother years earlier, a painfully slow death that took a toll on her entire family. The prospect of that happening to her was all Johnson had been able to think about since she’d discovered a tender lump in her right breast weeks before, prompting her doctor to send her for a mammogram.

If she got sick, who would keep up with feeding the horses and chickens at the 101-acre family farm that she and her husband ran in northeastern Kentucky? Who would care for the three young children they’d recently adopted after raising five kids of their own?

Johnson, 53 at the time, says she ripped open the envelope, unfolded the letter and began to read. She says her eyes fixated on four words in the first sentence: “no evidence of cancer.”

“Oh my gosh,” Johnson remembers thinking. “I dodged a bullet.”

Her husband, Delbert, choked up when she called him with the news. That night, they loaded the kids into the car and headed to Tumbleweed Tex Mex Grill to celebrate.

Only, as medical experts who reviewed her records later told her, there’d been a terrible mistake.

As Johnson dined with her family, a cancerous tumor was silently growing inside of her. The warning signs were there in the initial X-rays of her breast — enough to warrant additional tests at the very least, according to doctors who later reviewed the images. But someone at the hospital had sent the wrong letter, Johnson’s lawyers allege, giving Johnson the all-clear instead of directing her to return for a follow-up exam.

By the time Johnson discovered the discrepancy 10 months later — thanks only to her own insistence on seeking a second opinion after the pain in her breast worsened — her new doctors feared it might be too late to save her.

Johnson didn’t know it then, but this was the start of a yearslong battle not only with a deadly disease, but with a health system and medical workers who, Johnson’s lawyers say, went to extraordinary lengths to cover up their error.

The letter Johnson says she received from Fleming County Hospital stated that her mammogram ""revealed no evidence of cancer."" NBC News

Johnson — who describes herself as “not a suing person” — ultimately filed a lawsuit because she wanted to know why her cancer wasn’t caught earlier. It took three years of litigation before Johnson, her lawyers and a digital forensics expert who reviewed her electronic patient records were able to piece together what they believe happened: In the days and weeks after Johnson filed a medical malpractice lawsuit in 2016, two hospital employees opened her electronic records and edited them, deleting evidence of the erroneous letter claiming that she was cancer-free, Johnson’s lawyers say.

The hospital then created fake letters and produced them as part of the court case purporting to have directed Johnson to seek additional tests, Johnson alleges in court filings. When questioned under oath, the doctor who’d been overseeing Johnson’s medical care pointed to the newly generated letters as evidence that Johnson was to blame for her own delay in treatment, court records show.

Andrew Garrett, the forensics expert who reviewed Johnson’s medical records on her behalf, has worked on hundreds of malpractice cases, for both patients and hospitals, to find evidence buried deep in electronic records. He described cases like Johnson’s as having a “smoking gun"" hidden in the records.

A spokeswoman for LifePoint Health, the hospital chain that purchased Fleming County Hospital seven months after Johnson’s mammogram in 2015, declined to comment, noting that Johnson’s lawsuit is still pending before the Kentucky Supreme Court.

Lawyers for the hospital chain have dismissed Johnson’s allegations in legal filings and during court hearings as “a conspiracy theory” that cannot be substantiated because the electronic record system the hospital was using for mammograms at the time is now defunct and was prone to glitches. The hospital has acknowledged one discrepancy in Johnson’s medical records but said it was the result of “a clerical error” by an employee who’d gotten Johnson confused with another patient with the same last name.

The hospital hired a separate digital forensics expert to review Johnson’s medical record, as Garrett did, but the hospital didn’t submit findings in court, according to court records.

Johnson’s lawyers said they don’t believe the hospital’s explanations. Neither does her family.

“I tend to put my trust in doctors and professionals, the system even,” Delbert Johnson said. “But they failed Kim and tried to hide it.”

The cover-up alleged in Johnson’s lawsuit highlights a growing threat facing patients in the age of electronic medical records: the potential manipulation of their records by health care providers to hide mistakes and minimize liability.

NBC News talked to more than 20 patient advocates, expert witnesses and malpractice attorneys who described dozens of cases from the last decade that hinged on the discovery of edits made to a patient's record. In some instances, nurses’ notes had been deleted. In others, procedures the patient should have had, but didn’t, were logged after they died, painting a false picture of the care they received. Collectively, the patients in those cases or their surviving families were awarded tens of millions of dollars in damages.

As in Johnson’s case, these edits are often only uncovered through dogged and expensive efforts by medical malpractice lawyers and digital forensic experts to gain access to what is known as the “audit trail” of the patient record, which shows who accessed the record and how they modified it.

It’s impossible to know the full scale of the issue: Health care providers almost always require patients or their families to sign a nondisclosure agreement as a condition of any legal settlement. And hospitals routinely fight to suppress audit trails from being introduced in court, arguing that the records are so complex that it’s too expensive and burdensome for health care providers to release the files.

“The cases are literally doubling in complexity because of these issues,” said Matthew Keris, a Pennsylvania attorney who specializes in defending health care providers in malpractice lawsuits. He argues that audit trails rarely reveal evidence that’s significant to a case. Yet hospitals like the ones he represents often end up spending tens of thousands of dollars to analyze the records once they’re introduced as evidence, needlessly driving up the cost of litigation and benefitting no one.

But some experts say cases like Johnson’s are more common than people may think.

Garrett, the forensics expert, is one of the few specialists in the United States with expertise in this emerging technical field. He said his firm has worked on approximately 500 medical malpractice cases over seven years and has found significant alterations to the patient’s record that favored the hospital in 85 percent of them.

In about a quarter of those, the revision history reveals what Garrett describes as a “complete cover-up.”

A grim prognosis

Although the January 2015 letter initially alleviated Johnson’s fears about having cancer, it did nothing to stop the pain in her right breast. Her primary care physician, Dr. Amanda Applegate, had told her it was most likely a staph infection and would be cured with antibiotics.

Applegate, who’d ordered Johnson’s mammogram, acknowledged in a 2017 deposition that she never followed up to learn the results, arguing that it was the responsibility of the radiologist who took the scans to share the findings with Johnson. Applegate and her lawyers did not respond to messages seeking comment.

Unaware that her mammogram had indicated a need for additional testing, Johnson spent nine months trying different prescriptions to treat infection, but the lump in her breast kept growing. Finally, in September 2015, Applegate wrote her a referral for another opinion.

On an overcast fall day, Johnson drove more than 80 miles to St. Elizabeth Fort Thomas Hospital in northern Kentucky, near Cincinnati. After examining Johnson’s breast, Dr. Heidi Murley ordered an emergency biopsy. Within days, Johnson returned to the hospital to receive the diagnosis she’d been dreading: The doctor told her that she had stage 4 cancer and that it had spread from her breast to her lymph nodes and bones.

The news came with a grim prognosis. An oncologist advised her to get her affairs in order. Based on how far the cancer had already spread, she might have just six months to live — maybe a year.","['medical', 'missed', 'care', 'hospital', 'cancer', 'mom', 'records', 'cases', 'court', 'kentucky', 'workers', 'johnsons', 'johnson', 'alleges', 'lawyers', 'mistake', 'covered', 'evidence']",2021-03-03 20:30:00+00:00

The meeting of Pope Francis and Ali al-Sistani, the spiritual leader of millions of Shiite Muslims, is believed to be the first between a pope and an Iraqi grand ayatollah.

Their brief encounter in the Iraqi holy city of Najaf will be written into history and comes at a crucial time for Iraq, a diverse, multifaith country deeply scarred by sectarian violence.

Francis’ first foreign trip since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and the first papal visit to Iraq also offers a moment of national pride for Iraqis and a rare opportunity to be at the center of a positive international news story.

“I long to meet you, see your faces, visit your land, ancient and extraordinary cradle of civilization,” Francis said Thursday ahead of his visit. “I arrive among you as a pilgrim of peace, to repeat: ‘You are all brothers.’”

The papal visit is risky. Francis will be traveling amid a second wave of the coronavirus there, and soon after 10 rockets rained down on the Ain al-Asad air base, northwest of Baghdad, on Wednesday.

But a morale boost is much needed: Iraq is still struggling to heal after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 plunged the country into chaos. The pandemic, low oil prices and tensions between Iran and the United States all add to its malaise.

“I am happy because such an important figure is going to visit Iraq,” Miqdad Radhi, a Shiite waiter in Baghdad, said. “We badly need to live as one people, no matter which faith or sect we follow, and the visit of the pope will help strengthen unity among Iraqis.”

Francis, 84, has spent years trying to improve Christian-Muslim relations, and his meeting with al-Sistani will be one of his most important with a Shiite leader. He has already forged ties with the prominent Sunni leader, Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand imam of Al-Azhar, the seat of Sunni learning in Cairo, with whom he signed a document of fraternity in 2019.

“Francis over the last few years has been indeed very bent on building what we might call a religious alliance between Christianity and Islam,” said Austen Ivereigh, a biographer of Francis and a fellow in contemporary church history at the University of Oxford. “The alliance really consists of forging bonds of friendship and trust with Muslim leaders.”

As archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis built strong relationships with Muslim leaders, Ivereigh said, and while at the Vatican he has worked to build a Christian-Muslim alliance as a way to combat the cycle of Islamic terrorism and nationalist populist reactions.

Al-Sistani, 90, has similarly called for peaceful coexistence and dialogue among faiths, according to Hayder al-Khoei, director of foreign relations at the Al-Khoei Institute, a seminary and interfaith academy based in Najaf.

As the Islamic State militant group targeted Shiites, Christians, Yazidis, among others, al-Sistani embraced victims no matter what their faith, added al-Khoei, whose grandfather was the Grand Ayatollah Abul Qassim al-Khoei, a predecessor of al-Sistani.

“I think it’s part of the DNA of the religious establishment in Najaf,” he added, referring to religious tolerance and dialogue.

Al-Sistani’s role is more informal than the pope’s and is based on his following. Both elderly, Francis suffers from sciatica and last year al-Sistani underwent surgery for a fractured bone.

Described as a reclusive leader who is rarely seen in public, the grand ayatollah has nevertheless maintained a powerful voice in Iraq and built a strong following in the Shiite-majority country and beyond.

While he is Iranian-born, he is seen as a counterweight to Iran as he represents a Shiite school of thought opposed to direct rule by clerics, the system in place across the border.

Thaer al-Saidy, a student in the religious establishment in Najaf known as the Hawza and a follower of al-Sistani, said the grand ayatollah was the “spiritual father” of all Iraqis irrespective of their faith.

In 2014, the grand ayatollah issued an order for all able-bodied Iraqis to take up arms against ISIS, a move that today is widely seen as crucial in having helped turn the tide against the militants.

“He preserved the unity of Iraq and preserved the religious minorities of all faiths and sects,” al-Saidy said, reflecting on that order.

The 2014 call to arms also, however, massively swelled the ranks of Shiite militias which today wield enormous influence in Iraq.

After years of sectarian conflict, most Iraqis are desperate for peaceful coexistence among faiths. But there is one group in particular that hopes Francis’ visit will help heal deep wounds.

Iraq’s ancient Christian community was targeted long before ISIS came to occupy vast swaths of the country in 2014, going back to the aftermath of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that overthrew Saddam Hussein and beyond.

Under ISIS, Christians were again forced to flee their homes, accelerating the decline of an already dwindling population. In a 2019 report, the U.S. Department of State cited Christian leaders’ estimates that there were fewer than 250,000 Christians remaining in Iraq, compared to somewhere between 800,000 and 1.4 million people before 2002.

The majority of Christians in Iraq are Chaldean Catholics, an eastern rite of the Roman Catholic Church, according to the report.

Iraqi Christians hope the pontiff’s presence will shine a light on their suffering.

“I think the government is going to pay more attention to us after the visit of the pope,” said Wissam Joseph, 38, a Christian whose family was forced to flee Al Qaeda when the militants took over his Baghdad neighborhood in 2008.

Joseph is among those who believe the Iraqi government has done little to help Christians who were forced to leave their homes. Despite Iraq’s announcement in December 2017 that it had defeated ISIS, some Christians still have not returned to their properties, many of which were destroyed in the fighting.

In 2016, then-Secretary of State John Kerry designated that the militants were responsible for genocide against Yazidis, Shiites, as well as Christians. ISIS also targeted Sunnis, among others, who would not adhere to the group’s strict interpretation of Islam.

Iraqis are proud to live in the birthplace of Abraham, the prophet of central importance to Muslims, Christians and Jews. Some hope the pontiff’s visit will remind the world of this rich history.

“To see his holiness walk on the same soil whence Abraham has walked in Nasiriyah in southern Iraq, that would be a wonderful thing,” said Abbas Kadhim, the director of the Iraq initiative at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, D.C.

“This will remind people that Iraq is actually the place where it all began. Iraq is not called the cradle of civilizations for nothing.”

Sheikh Fakher Khalaf Khudeda, a Yazidi religious leader from Sinjar, in northern Iraq, echoed those from across the religious spectrum who hope Francis’ visit can somehow lead to a more peaceful nation.

“The pope is visiting the country and brings with him a message of peace, this message is not only for Muslims and Christians, but for all Iraqis from all faiths,” he said.

Every American who filed individually and makes up to $75,000 would still get the full amount before it begins to reduce at incomes above that. But rather than zero out at $100,000 earnings, as the last Covid-19 relief bill does, the Senate bill would cut off payments at $80,000, the sources said.

For couples filing jointly, incomes up to $150,000 would still get the full amount. But rather than zero out at $200,000, the Senate bill would cut off payments at $160,000 in earnings.

For taxpayers filing as heads of households, the new plan would make the full $1,400 available for those earning under $112,500, with the payment zeroing out at $120,000.

Essentially, the payments would phase out at a faster rate under the new proposal Wednesday, which came one day after Biden met with moderate Democratic senators who voiced some concerns and said the relief should be more narrowly targeted.

But it would maintain the crucial $1,400 top-line number for the bulk of recipients, a campaign promise that Biden was determined to keep. It was also a closing pitch by Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in the Georgia runoffs in January, which helped Democrats capture two seats and seize control of the Senate.

Ossoff told reporters on Thursday that the reduced eligibility doesn't amount to a broken promise because incomes up to $75,000 can still get the full payment.

""This is what Georgians sent us to Washington to fight for, and this is what we’re going to deliver,"" he said, emphasizing that it is ""vital"" that Democrats ""hold the line"" on that.

The changes from the restricted eligibility would save $12 billion, said Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who made clear he preferred to keep the cutoff at the $100,000 to $200,000 level.

The Senate bill would maintain $400-per-week federal unemployment benefits through August, like the House bill that passed early Saturday, one of the sources said.

The Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to proceed to the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill as early as Thursday, with a final vote possible by the end of the week.

Party leaders are still waiting for a score from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that affirms that the legislation would comply with rules under the reconciliation process, which enables Democrats in the evenly split Senate to bypass the filibuster and approve the bill with a simple majority.

It is the second time Democrats have narrowed the new round of $1,400 stimulus checks. To appease moderates, the House bill had phased out the $1,400 payments a bit more quickly than earlier bills, with couples making $199,000 receiving no money compared to previous bills when they got some money.

The deal would also have an impact on dependent payments of up to $1,400 per dependent.

Some Democrats had argued against narrowing the eligibility criteria, warning that it would anger people who were included in previous rounds of cash payments during the Trump administration and didn't expect to be left out this time.

The House bill got no Republican votes and no Republican senators are on board with it, as party leaders decry the package as a ""liberal wish list.""

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that the package is ""an American wish list"" that ""includes a whole bunch of bipartisan amendments that were accepted,"" such as help for restaurants, a vaccination public awareness program and more targeting of direct payments.

He pointed to polls that show broad public support, including among Republican voters.

""It seems like the only people who are dead set against this bill are Republican senators — not Republicans out in the country,"" Schumer said.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., criticized it as a partisan bill, unlike previous relief efforts last year, and said some provisions would be spent over several years.

""The Democrats had a choice. They chose to go it alone, tack to the left and leave families’ top priorities on the cutting-room floor,"" he said.

29,"['Henry J. Gomez', 'Henry J. Gomez Is A National Politics Reporter For Nbc News Digital.']","CLEVELAND — Josh Mandel, a Republican candidate for the Senate in Ohio, is waging an unadulterated campaign to pull his party further to the right, in part by trashing the state's Republican governor.

A day after governors in Mississippi and Texas lifted mask mandates and other guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Mandel on Wednesday called on Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine to do the same.

""I think Mike DeWine is a squishy establishment politician who went along with the peer pressure and the groupthink of liberal media and other squishy governors around the country when he should have been a leader,"" Mandel, a former two-term state treasurer, said in an interview.

Mandel's remarks escalate his bid to position himself as the Republican most in sync with former President Donald Trump in the race to succeed GOP Sen. Rob Portman, who will not seek another term next year.

Mandel has amplified the lie that the election was stolen from Trump. He has relentlessly attacked an opponent, former Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken, for the nice things she said about a Republican House member who voted to impeach Trump. And since he appeared last week at the CPAC conference for conservative activists in Florida, Mandel has branded DeWine — whose career in Republican politics goes back to 1977, when Mandel was born — with words like ""squishy"" and ""RINO,"" meaning Republican In Name Only.

In another sign that he wants to carve out his own far-right lane in a primary campaign that could soon be crowded with other pro-Trump conservatives, Mandel asserted Wednesday that masks are not effective against the coronavirus.

""There's no science or math that shows that it's been helpful,"" he said, overlooking data and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other experts that confirms that properly covering your mouth and nose helps prevent the spread of viral particles.

""No,"" Mandel replied when asked whether he would continue wearing a mask in public if DeWine lifts the mandate. ""We need to stop the mask mandates immediately. And I will stop wearing a mask. I have the freedom to make decisions based on what's best for me and my family. And this has gone way overboard.""

A spokesperson for DeWine, Dan Tierney, said it was too soon to ease off all mandates and restrictions. He did not respond to Mandel's attacks on DeWine.

""We still have a pandemic. We still do not have herd immunity,"" Tierney said. ""The good news is we're getting an increased supply"" of vaccines, and ""there is light at the end of the tunnel.""

Mandel's latest moves illustrate how he is trying to set a Trumpian tone and rules of engagement in the early stages of the primary campaign. Timken, the former state party chair, has been a close Trump ally, but early efforts on her behalf to secure Trump's endorsement have been unsuccessful. After days of pressure from Mandel on Twitter, Timken this week backtracked from her praise for Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in January.

Timken also has been an ally of DeWine's. As state party chair, she discouraged calls for a primary challenge that grew out of conservative frustrations — which Mandel is using his Senate campaign's bully pulpit to air — with DeWine's continued insistence on masks and other social distancing guidelines.

DeWine's relatively cautious approach to the pandemic, especially compared with the approaches of other Republican governors, earned him bipartisan praise early in the crisis. A Baldwin Wallace University poll of likely voters last fall found that nearly 72 percent of respondents approved of how DeWine was handling the pandemic.

""Ohio has led the way and done better than many other states in tackling the pandemic,"" Timken said in an emailed statement, opening with implicit praise for DeWine. ""With declining Covid-19 cases, the increasing availability of vaccines and the coming arrival of spring, now is the time to fully reopen Ohio's economy and ensure every child can attend school in-person.""

Timken, unlike Mandel, said she ""will continue to wear a mask personally when I think it's appropriate, but that is a personal choice that every Ohioan should have the liberty to make, which is why we must also end government mask mandates.""

Another major factor in deciphering Mandel's anti-DeWine message is whom he might face in the general election if he wins the nomination.

Dr. Amy Acton, who was DeWine's first health director and became a household name in Ohio last year during televised briefings about the state's pandemic response, is considering running as a Democrat. Every time Mandel criticizes DeWine, he blasts Acton by name, too. Mandel said Wednesday that he would ""cherish"" the opportunity to run against her because ""she was a complete failure.""

A spokesperson for Acton declined to comment Wednesday.","['mandate', 'timken', 'gop', 'senate', 'takes', 'hopeful', 'states', 'dewine', 'trump', 'party', 'ohio', 'aim', 'pandemic', 'governor', 'mandel', 'republican', 'mask']",2021-03-03 23:51:00+00:00
30,[],"The Transportation Department’s watchdog asked the Justice Department to criminally investigate Elaine Chao late last year over concerns that she misused her office when she was transportation secretary under President Donald Trump but was rebuffed, according to a report released Wednesday.

The report said the Justice Department’s criminal and public integrity divisions declined in December to take up the case for criminal prosecution following the inspector general’s findings that Chao used her staff and office for personal tasks and to promote a shipping business owned by Chao's father and sisters, in an apparent violation of federal ethics rules. That company does extensive business with China.

“A formal investigation into potential misuses of position was warranted,” deputy inspector general Mitch Behm wrote in a letter to lawmakers.

Chao, the wife of Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, stepped down from her job early this year in the last weeks of the Trump administration, citing her disapproval over the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol by Trump’s supporters.

Chao has denied wrongdoing.

In the report released Wednesday, she did not specifically respond to allegations, instead providing a September 2020 memo that argued promoting her family was an appropriate part of her official duties at the department.

“Asian audiences welcome and respond positively to actions by the secretary that include her father in activities when appropriate,” that memo said.

The watchdog report cited several instances that raised ethical concerns. In one, Chao instructed political appointees in the department to contact the Homeland Security Department to check personally on the status of a work permit application for a student who was a recipient of her family’s philanthropic foundation.

Chao also made extensive plans for an official trip to China in November 2017 — before she canceled it — that would have included stops at places that had received support from her family’s business, the New York-based Foremost Group. According to department emails, Chao directed her staff to include her relatives in the official events and high-level meetings during the trip.

“Above all, let’s keep (the Secretary) happy,"" one of the department’s employees wrote to another staffer regarding Chao’s father. “If Dr. Chao is happy, then we should be flying with a feather in our hat.”

The report found that Chao also directed the department’s public affairs staff to assist her father in the marketing of his personal biography and to edit his Wikipedia page, and used staff to check on repairs of an item at a store for her father.

The IG report said Justice Department officials ultimately declined to take up a criminal review, saying there “may be ethical and/or administrative issues” but no evidence to support possible criminal charges.

As a result, the inspector general's office said in the report it was now closing its investigation “based on the lack of prosecutorial interest” from the Justice Department.

Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon, chairman of the House transportation committee, who requested the investigation, expressed disappointment that the review was not completed and released while Chao was still in office.

“Public servants, especially those responsible for leading tens of thousands of other public servants, must know that they serve the public and not their family’s private commercial interests,” he said.","['secretary', 'watchdog', 'department', 'chao', 'staff', 'justice', 'transportation', 'departments', 'faulted', 'office', 'elaine', 'father', 'report', 'public', 'misuse']",2021-03-04 03:30:54+00:00

The data also showed that 95 of the 625 who had been waiting more than 72 hours for transfer to custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, were under 13 years old.

The influx of unaccompanied migrants under 18 at border facilities is due in part to the Biden administration's reversal of a Trump-era policy that expelled unaccompanied migrant children, along with all other migrants, under provisions invoked during the coronavirus pandemic.

Under the Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act, migrant children who cross the border without parents or legal guardians are supposed to be transferred to HHS custody within 72 hours. CBP facilities are not designed to house children for extended periods, while at HHS facilities they have access to school, outdoor space and child welfare professionals. Caseworkers for HHS can help match children with relatives or sponsors who can care for them while they go through their immigration court proceedings in the U.S.

At the end of May 2019, when a surge of unaccompanied migrant children at the border meant children were sleeping on concrete while they waited in Border Patrol custody, more than 1,400 children had been waiting for transfer to HHS facilities for more than 72 hours.

President Joe Biden was briefed about the spike in unaccompanied migrant children Tuesday at the White House, where he was told that this year's surge could top the record of 76,000 unaccompanied children who crossed the border in 2019. Asked whether there was a crisis, he told reporters, ""We'll be able to handle it, God willing.""

Immigration and child welfare advocates have criticized the Biden administration for opening temporary influx facilities, which are unlicensed, but they have said being housed in the facilities is better than waiting in Border Patrol custody.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Monday that his agency is considering ""co-locating"" HHS personnel in Border Patrol stations who can match children quickly with sponsors without bringing them into the custody of HHS at all.","['custody', 'children', 'backlog', 'border', 'patrol', 'data', '72', 'growing', 'facilities', 'hhs', 'unaccompanied', 'waiting', 'migrant']",2021-03-04 01:29:00+00:00

Lee Is An Nbc News Correspondent.']","WASHINGTON — Last July 30, then-President Donald Trump suggested on Twitter that the date of the presidential election be changed. It was just one of hundreds of seemingly spurious presidential thoughts to be given a public airing on social media, but on that occasion, it was met with a rare response from the Democratic presidential nominee in a tweet of his own.

“You won’t have to worry about my tweets when I’m president,” Joe Biden promised.

Now, six weeks into the Biden administration, it’s not the president but his White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, whose online activity is generating the most intrigue in Washington.

For a White House that prides itself, so far, on being light on leaks and staying mostly on message, Klain’s frequent tweets can at times offer rare insight into the thinking and priorities of the Biden West Wing.

Klain may have one of the busiest and most demanding jobs in Washington, but he is tweeting, retweeting and liking posts seemingly all hours of the day, setting off cellphone screens across Washington an average of 60 times a day, according to an NBC News review of his Twitter use.

Klain “likes” tweets more than he posts his own or retweets others’ postings. But looking solely at his tweets and retweets from the inauguration on Jan. 20 through late February, he's posted 1,264 times — an average of about 34 times a day. By comparison, White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted a total of only 43 times in the same 37-day stretch.

Trump himself averaged about 140 tweets per month in his first 100 days, according to an NBC News analysis at the time.

Most of Klain’s tweets — about 40 percent — are retweets from journalists or news organizations who post about the work of the administration. He also amplifies other Biden administration officials’ tweets, including @POTUS, accounting for about 1 in 5 tweets. His own tweets are heavy on Covid-19 messaging, or general “cheerleading” the administration’s work.

One of his most popular tweets so far, according to NBC’s review, was actually a message responding to Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who ironically tweeted one weekend morning about being relieved not to see ""mean"" tweets from the White House. “Quick tweet to say we’re working at the WH today on next steps in the COVID response,” Klain wrote. “Enjoy your toast.”

Hi @amyklobuchar: Quick tweet to say we're working at the WH today on next steps in the COVID response, making sure we're ready for the winter storm, and advancing the American Rescue Package. Enjoy your toast. https://t.co/rRM8BPtZ0G — Ronald Klain (@WHCOS) January 30, 2021

He's also used Twitter to communicate with lawmakers on Capitol Hill — mostly Democrats, but also several Republicans. After Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia sent Klain a letter raising concerns about a regulatory freeze the administration had imposed, Klain responded first on Twitter, promising to look into the issue.

Thanks Senator Capito — we will quickly look at this and get back to you. https://t.co/UMIkIidGWd — Ronald Klain (@WHCOS) February 17, 2021

White House officials say Klain alone manages his account, neither taking direction from nor seeking input from his communications, political or digital strategy teams. But they say Klain sees his engagement on the platform as a means of encouraging for his staff, promoting the White House’s message and engaging with constituencies across the political spectrum, especially progressive activists.

“He’s been working for the president on and off for decades. He knows his thinking, knows his priorities, knows what he cares about. So certainly what he’s projecting and communicating about is reflective of what we’re focused on internally day to day,” Psaki said. “But it isn’t done through hours of navigation. It’s just done to ensure we’re using all the levers at our disposal to communicate with the public, even if we don’t think it’s the only way to communicate with the public.”

During last year's campaign, Biden’s team had what could be called a like-hate relationship with the platform, regularly attacking Trump’s tweeting and regularly reminding reporters and pundits that “Twitter is not real life.” Often, though, they bluntly vented their frustration on the same forum, challenging reporters and activists they felt put too much stock in the hot takes of the “blue check” crowd (after Twitter's verification symbol) and not nearly enough in more Biden-friendly, but more off-line constituencies.

Now, Biden officials see Klain’s Twitter account as one of their main messaging channels to progressive forces they see as a key part of their governing coalition. For example, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee features one of Klain’s tweets in a new cable TV ad slated to begin airing in Washington, D.C. on Friday.

“Clearly his preference is to have everyone bought in and fighting alongside each other,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “I see Ron’s twitter engagement as an extension of his larger ethos of lifting up some progressive ideas and keeping lines of communication very open. It sends a signal.”

As they turned from the campaign to governing, Biden’s digital team encouraged everyone from the most junior staff to the most senior Cabinet members to create their own accounts — a contrast to the Obama administration, where official Twitter accounts were more sparing.

“We decided pretty early on we want people engaging on Twitter,” said Rob Flaherty, the White House digital director. “It's not because we think Twitter is real life suddenly, but because the news cycle sort of just sort of billows out there and having more voices there is better.”

Officials with Twitter accounts do receive occasional messaging guidance, but the digital team is otherwise hands off and not managing most individual accounts.

Flaherty said Klain put a lot of thought into how he’d use his official account. He chose to create “@WHCOS,” rather than the formulation most officials used of their own name followed by “46,” so that it could be an account passed on to his successors in the same way @PressSec has been transferred from press secretary to press secretary.

It’s unlikely any future chief of staff would tweet as often as Klain. Most other members of Biden’s inner circle not only don’t tweet, but don’t even have accounts.

But Psaki insisted Klain’s tweeting was not impeding his work.

And while they now have enough masks, ventilators and emergency room space to treat a new wave of patients, they say there is an acute shortage of staffers who aren’t already stressed out and exhausted from battling the pandemic for more than a year.

“We have the capacity to take care of more patients,” Dr. James McDeavitt of the Baylor College of Medicine told NBC News. “We have an ample supply of PPE. That means a lot. The more difficult problem is that while many people in Texas experienced the pandemic in waves, there’s been no respite for front-line health care providers. The biggest issue now is morale. Many health care providers fear this could extend the pandemic.”

McDeavitt, the Houston hospital’s senior vice president and dean of clinical affairs, said he shares these fears.

“I think the governor’s decision was premature,” he said. “If the goal is to reach herd immunity, we are not there yet. Masking and distancing are an important bridge to herd immunity. We’re still seeing 1,000 new cases per day in Houston. We’re getting some 200 new Covid-19 patients per day in the hospitals. Yes, the numbers are down considerably, but that’s still pretty high.”

Houston Methodist President and CEO Dr. Marc Boom said the hardest thing for his exhausted staffers to swallow is the knowledge “that we are 90 to 120 days away from a much better situation.""

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

“Our staff is tired and we’re still in the midst of a third surge,” he said. “Now, everybody is contemplating a fourth surge of infections.”

Why? Because last month’s freak winter storm, which knocked out power to much of the state, forced many Texans to abandon their homes and head to heated shelters where there was little, if any, social distancing.

“Give us 90 to 120 more days and the world will look a lot better,” Boom said. “Wearing a mask may not be mandated, but it’s a personal responsibility as the governor himself said. And we are urging people to continue wearing their masks.”

Both Boom and McDeavitt said that no matter what happens, thanks to the vaccines any new surge won’t be as bad as the prior waves of infections.

“As I said, I think the governor’s decision was premature and I think it will cause another surge,” McDeavitt said. “But I don’t think this is Armageddon. I don’t think this is the end of the world. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and it is getting closer.”

Abbott, a Republican who resisted imposing restrictions early on in the pandemic, surprised Texans on Tuesday by suddenly lifting the state’s mask mandate, rolling back many of the Covid-19 health guidelines, and declaring, “It is now time to open Texas 100 percent.”

That same day, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced that he was lifting his state’s mask mandate. He too is a Republican.

“We never attempted to say that we're trying to keep every single Mississippian from contracting the virus,” Reeves said Wednesday on Fox Business Network. “Our goal has always been to protect the integrity of our health care system such that if anyone gets the virus, if they can get better with quality care, that they receive that quality care.”

President Joe Biden called the moves by Abbott and Reeves examples of “Neanderthal thinking” and blasted both leaders for easing restrictions even after the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned against complacency in the face of emerging coronavirus variants.

""I think it's a big mistake,” Biden said Wednesday. “Look, I hope everybody realizes by now that masks make a big difference.”

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, however, praised Abbott and said the governor “has moved in the absolute right direction.”

“This is a pandemic that was going to spread one way or the other, and there are certainly things we can do to protect ourselves, but we can't protect everyone all the time, and it is going to spread to some degree,” Paxton said Wednesday on Fox News. “I just think it's time for individual responsibility as opposed to government oversight.”

Paxton, a Republican, is under FBI investigation for allegedly using his office to aid a wealthy political donor.

Dr. Matt Dacso, an internist at the University of Texas Medical Branch, told The Houston Chronicle that Abbott’s announcement hit him like an episode of post-traumatic stress disorder.

“I can think of no other word but incomprehensible,” he said. “Everybody is hurting, but gosh, man. The masks were doing a lot for us.”

San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg said ditching the mask mandate while opening businesses at 100 percent capacity is a “huge mistake.”

“Covid-19 is still widespread in our community and infecting too many of our vulnerable residents,” he said in a statement Tuesday. “You don’t cut off your parachute just as you’ve slowed your descent.”

Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo noted that Abbott’s announcement came as Texas was trying to get vaccine distribution back on track after it was derailed by the deadly winter storm that knocked out power across much of the state. Abbott and the rest of the Republicans who run much of the state have gotten an earful from residents angry about the failure of the Texas power grid.

“With the arrival of Covid-19 vaccines, we’re inching closer to the finish line of this pandemic — now is not the time to reverse the gains we’ve worked so hard to achieve,” she said Tuesday. “At best, today’s decision is wishful thinking. At worst, it is a cynical attempt to distract Texans from the failures of state oversight of our power grid.”

In Mississippi, hospital administrators said they were ready for the worst.

“The easy answer is the governor’s announcement will not affect us,” said Marc Rolph, chief spokesman for the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. “We never let our guard down so there is no need for us to do any extra prep work.

The Spurs coach said he's particularly concerned for business owners who want to keep customers and workers safe but will have no authority to tell patrons to wear masks.

""They're trying to do a good job of keeping everybody safe. Of course they want to open up. But getting rid of masks just seems ignorant to me,"" said Popovich, who will serve as Team USA's head basketball coach at the upcoming Olympics. ""People that didn't want to wear masks in the first place, how do the businesses get them to wear masks? Well, now they don't have to. So now there will be more infections, one would think.""

Abbott said Tuesday that his new executive order would rescind most of his previous Covid-19 executive orders and that all businesses would be allowed to open ""100 percent"" effective March 10.

A representative for Abbott could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.

While rates of infections are generally coming down across the U.S., thousands of people are still dying. As of Wednesday afternoon, nearly 14,000 people had died from Covid-19 over the previous seven days, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Texas still has one of the country's highest rates of infection, as more than 12.3 percent of coronavirus tests in the state came back positive over the last seven days, according to Johns Hopkins University data reported Wednesday. Public health officials have said local governments should use a 5 percent positivity rate as a benchmark to safely reopen.

""But when all of a sudden we act like it's over with, when all the science tells us the opposite, it's basically you're saying: 'You get inflected, you die, it's the way it goes. We got to open up,'"" Popovich said. ""That's not the way to do it. This is really ridiculous.""

Popovich said he fears that getting rid of mask mandates could lead to a surge in cases similar to the deadly fall and winter spike, which was linked to holiday travel and lax adherence to safeguards.

""It's like we have to have instant gratification,"" Popovich said. ""We already went through this once, and now we're going to do it again.""

37,['Associated Press'],"MEXICO CITY — Even as other countries institute airport testing, tracing and mandatory isolation, Mexican authorities bragged Wednesday about the speed with which they let tourists exit the terminal at the resort of Cancún.

Mexico’s National Immigration Institute, the INM, said Wednesday it took tourists an average of only one to two minutes to enter the country.

“The INM is working to maintain and offer rapid service, with quality and warmth,” the institute said.

During peak hours Tuesday, checkpoints at the Cancún airport processed almost 9,000 tourists arriving on dozens of flights.

Mexico has not recovered the level of tourism it had before the pandemic; the overall numbers of tourists arriving at the Cancún airport, one of Mexico’s busiest, was about 1.3 million in January, 54.7% lower than the same month of 2020, when almost 2.3 million passengers landed there.

But Mexico is one of the few nations in Latin America, and the world, to have instituted almost no measures to limit travelers, require mandatory testing or isolation upon arrival.

Passengers bound for Mexico just have to fill out a form asking about their risk factors for COVID-19 and their contact details.

International arrivals in Cancún took the biggest hit in January, but domestic arrivals of people boarding flights within Mexico to Cancún were down only about 18%.

Flights from the U.S. dried up last spring as the pandemic took hold but returned to near-normal during the holiday season. In December, Quintana Roo, the state where Cancún is located, was averaged 460 air arrivals and departures per day compared to a pre-pandemic average of 500. Tourism accounts for 87% of Quintana Roo’s gross domestic product.

Braddock, 48, said he had grown somewhat accustomed to being stopped by police because his identity had been stolen and he was sometimes mistaken for the man who had been using his name. He carried paperwork with him from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension as proof, he said, so the stops were usually brief: He would show the paperwork to officers; they'd review it and let him go. But the officer at his driver's side window that day stuffed the documents in his pocket without looking at them, Braddock said.

When he hesitated to get out of the car, the officer aggressively hit the driver's side window with a flashlight, Braddock said. Two officers then tried to pull him from the car before he got out on his own.

""Then they tried to slam me on the ground, but I was about 240 pounds,"" Braddock said, adding that although he still was unsure why he was stopped, he complied to avoid injury. ""Then they jumped on my head and my neck and my back. I was lying flat on the ground.""

More than six years later, Braddock saw one of those officers again as he watched a harrowing video of George Floyd's final moments. Derek Chauvin, Braddock said, was one of the officers who had treated him roughly. A police report from that night confirms that Chauvin was one of the arresting officers.

Floyd, who was Black, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for several minutes while he cried out for help in handcuffs and said he couldn't breathe. His death sparked months of racial justice protests in dozens of cities around the world.

Chauvin, who is charged with second-degree murder in Floyd's death, is set to stand trial Monday.

Braddock said he believes Floyd might still be alive if the complaint he filed alleging excessive force by Chauvin the day after their encounter had been taken seriously and not dismissed.

""It's unfortunate that they didn't do anything to Derek Chauvin,"" Braddock said in a recent interview. ""If they had done something about it, it might not have went that far.""

Multiple people who had run-ins with Chauvin before the deadly encounter have accused him in interviews with news outlets and official complaints of using excessive force.

Chauvin, who was a 19-year veteran of the department before he was fired, was named in more than a dozen complaints that resulted in no disciplinary action and one that led to a ""letter of reprimand.""

The Minneapolis Police Department declined to comment about past complaints against Chauvin.

The Minnesota Attorney General's Office, which is prosecuting Chauvin's case, sought to introduce several arrests involving Chauvin dating as far back as 2014, alleging that they showed a history of excessive force.

Jurors may hear about one of those cases, the arrest of Zoya Code in 2017.

'Don't kill me'

According to court documents, Chauvin went to Code's home on June 25, 2017, on a report of a domestic dispute. A relative had accused Code, 38, of trying to choke her with an extension cord, but Code denied having done so. Code, who declined a request for an interview, told The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that covers the criminal justice system, that the relative was swinging the cord around and that she had grabbed hold of it. Code said she had left the house to cool off after the dispute and that when she returned, she encountered Chauvin and another officer.

As Code walked by, Chauvin grabbed one of her arms and told her she was under arrest, prosecutors said in court documents. When she pulled away, Chauvin pulled her to the ground in the prone position and knelt on her, they said. After she was handcuffed, she refused to stand, so Chauvin carried her out of the house in a prone position and set her face down on the sidewalk.

Code told The Marshall Project that she began pleading: ""Don't kill me.""

According to the prosecutors' account, based on the police report and body camera video, at that point, Chauvin told his partner to restrain Code's ankles, ""even though she was not providing any physical resistance.""

Code told The Marshall Project that as he tied her, she told the officer: ""You're learning from an animal. That man — that's evilness right there.""

Code was charged with misdemeanor domestic assault and disorderly conduct. The charges were dismissed March 12, 2018.

Code is listed as a prospective witness for the state in Chauvin's trial. Prosecutors will juxtapose Code's treatment with Chauvin's actions in another case to demonstrate that Chauvin knew how to use reasonable force to restrain a person.

In that incident, Chauvin rendered aid to a suicidal, intoxicated and mentally disturbed man. ""Defendant observed other officers fight with and tase the male,"" prosecutors wrote in a court filing. ""Defendant then observed other officers place the male in a side-recovery position, consistent with training.""

Chauvin rode to the hospital with the man, according to prosecutors. He and the other officers were commended by the police department for their efforts.

'He choked me out on the ground'

Other people who encountered Chauvin said his actions were much less measured.

Julian Hernandez, a carpenter, said he was on a road trip to Minneapolis in February 2015, with 20 or so of his co-workers to see a band at the El Nuevo Rodeo nightclub, where Chauvin worked as an off-duty security officer for almost 17 years. Hernandez said that he had been drinking and went to the bar to try to buy cigarettes but that they were too expensive. Hernandez said that as he walked away from the bar, he heard someone say, ""It's time to go."" He turned around and encountered Chauvin, who he said forced him to an exit.

""The whole club was still going,"" said Hernandez, 38. ""And he picked me out of everybody and told me that I had to go because they were going to close.""

He said he tried to tell Chauvin that he needed to retrieve his jacket from the coat check and even showed him his ticket.

""I'm like, 'Dude, let me go get my jacket at least. It's wintertime,'"" Hernandez said. ""And he wouldn't let me.""

Once they got outside, ""things got physical,"" Hernandez said.

""He tried to grab me from my neck, and, of course, I reacted,"" Hernandez said. ""And then, after that, he choked me out on the ground.""

Chauvin restrained Hernandez ""by applying pressure to"" his lingual artery below his chin and ""pressing him"" against a wall, according to prosecutors. He then pulled Hernandez to the ground, placed him in a prone position, handcuffed him and waited for other officers to arrive, they said.

He said he distinctly recalled Chauvin's choking him. Hernandez said that at the time, he had been clean for about six years after having served time in prison in California in his early 20s for selling drugs.

Hernandez said he filed a formal complaint the day after the incident, which was later dismissed, and that he tried to sue the police department but that no lawyer would take his case. He wasn't trying to sue for financial reasons, he said. ""I just wanted them to know what kind of cop they have on their squad,"" he said.

Hernandez was charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct. He pleaded guilty a couple of months later and, after he stayed out of trouble for a year, the court vacated the plea and dismissed the case, records show. Hernandez's case was among those prosecutors sought to submit as evidence, but a judge denied the request.

""What he did to me was nothing compared to what he did to that poor Black dude,"" Hernandez said, referring to Floyd. ""You can't take the law in your own hands.""

In a court filing, Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, said he acted appropriately. The filing says the encounter with Hernandez involved Chauvin ""at bar close after Valentine's Day, in the dark, early morning hours dealing with a resistant, aggressive arrestee by himself.""

""Chauvin ascertained and reported that the arrestee was actively resisting,"" the filing states. ""Under the Minneapolis Police Department Use of Force policy in effect at the time, a neck restraint could 'be used against a subject who is actively resisting.'""

Nelson didn't return a request for comment about the allegations.

Hernandez said he believes that if Chauvin's superiors had ""looked more into"" complaints about ""his aggressiveness"" and reprimanded him, ""he would still be a cop and George Floyd would be alive.""

Braddock agreed.

Braddock, a former St. Paul resident who now lives in Chicago, said that the morning he was arrested, he asked Chauvin and the other officer why they had stopped him but that they never gave him an answer.

He was booked in the Hennepin County Jail on charges of failure to comply with police orders and obstruction of the legal process, according to a public information report, which said ""a routine license plate check"" of his vehicle showed the owner as having a felony warrant.

The case was dismissed in January 2014. Braddock's attorney at the time, Jordan Deckenbach, said prosecutors tossed the case after the City Attorney's Office reviewed the video from the squad car. The City Attorney's Office said it no longer had a record of why the case was dismissed.

The formal complaint Braddock filed against Chauvin the day after his detainment was also dismissed, he and his attorney said.

""The fact that Mr. Braddock's complaint was dismissed without him being contacted and interviewed is evidence that the complaint was not taken seriously,"" Deckenbach said. ""If Officer Chauvin had been disciplined for physically abusing Mr. Braddock, to include kneeling on Mr. Braddock's neck, perhaps Officer Chauvin would have taken a different approach with George Floyd, resulting in George Floyd still being alive today.""","['george', 'floyd', 'choked', 'allegations', 'knelt', 'officer', 'hernandez', 'dismissed', 'case', 'told', 'abuse', 'braddock', 'officers', 'prosecutors', 'chauvin']",2021-03-03 09:31:00+00:00

But the brown drip didn't feel like a reprieve for Johnson, 38, who lost water after back-to-back winter storms slammed the city and its century-old water infrastructure last month.

""It's not enough to do anything with, and it doesn't even look safe,"" said Johnson, the mother of children ages 9, 6 and 3.

Instead, Johnson and her fiancé are using melted snow and collected rainwater stored in four large coolers to flush the toilet. To clean dishes and hands, Johnson boils pots of water taken from a bathtub that was pre-filled when water was available.

""It has been absolutely horrible to live like this,"" she said.

Jackson has entered the third week of a crisis that has left much of the city without water since freezing temperatures devastated much of the South. Community leaders say that the disaster isn't a one-off and that it has brought to light long-simmering issues of systemic breakdown and neglect.

Weeks after the storm, the city continues to be under a boil water notice, and residents are being urged to conserve water and lower consumption as much as possible. Residents have been lining up at several sites that distribute non-potable water or water for flushing throughout the city. Many say they have been turned away after supplies ran out.

Jackson reported 96 main water breaks and leaks, 53 of which have been repaired, the mayor's office said a statement.

""Today we saw pressure stay around 83 to 85 psi. This is good, but ultimately, we need to get to 90 psi and stay there consistently in order for water to be restored to everyone. This is an old system and we are taking it day by day as it recharges itself,"" the statement said.

More than half of the city's schools are closed because of the water crisis; only 19 of nearly 50 public schools have reopened.

While it's still unclear how many residents are out of water, community leaders, like state Rep. Ronnie Crudup, say it's at least 40,000.

Staff members and volunteers with the MS Black Women's Roundtable recently joined with other community partners in providing critical resources like water, hot meals and other necessities at Wingfield High School as part of an ongoing relief effort underway in Jackson, Miss. Mississippi Black Women's Roundtable

Crudup has had no water for 16 days. He lives with his wife and two grandchildren, ages 9 and 10, in the hardest-hit part of the city, in South Jackson.

""We can't bathe, we can't cook food, we can't wash dishes, we can't do laundry. It's tremendously difficult,"" he said.

Crudup said that the city's infrastructure was already frail and that the crisis has highlighted how easily it can break.

""Infrastructure has been a historic problem, and for years each administration kept kicking that can down the road,"" he said. ""This is a longtime issue, but now we're paying a severe price for that neglect.""

Cassandra Welchlin, executive director of the Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable and co-founder of the Mississippi Women's Economic Security Initiative, a local nonprofit organization, said the water crisis has highlighted a slew of underlying issues long afflicting the community.

""This was a breakdown of a system that was supposed to be in place for the safety of our citizens,"" she said. ""This water crisis has really exacerbated a system that has never really worked for poor folks, Black folks, seniors, for so many people.""

Church as part of an ongoing relief effort underway in Jackson, Miss. Mississippi Black Women's Roundtable

Jackson's population is more than 80 percent Black.

Welchlin said the government hasn't invested in Jackson's infrastructure for a very long time.

""All of this is interconnected. Because of the water crisis, some families lost a week of pay because many people couldn't work. Teachers couldn't teach because they don't have internet connection. They don't have power. Many people were unable to provide, so this is a much larger issue than a lot of people might see,"" she said.

Welchlin and Crudup said state and federal intervention is necessary to fully address not just infrastructure but all of the underlying issues connected to the crisis.

In the interim, several groups have stepped up to aid community members. The Mississippi Women's Economic Security Initiative and other local organizations have coordinated supplies, water and services for residents in need. They have donated gift cards for food and bills and arranged for water trucks, and they have been dropping off cases of bottled water.

But many residents have also had to dip into their own pockets. Kehinde Gaynor, 42, has had to rent three hotel rooms in the last two weeks to give his wife and three children a place with safe water to bathe and wash.

Many residents have had to do that, he said, and the expenses have added up very quickly.

""Not having water isn't new to us. We've lost it before, but never as long as this,"" he said. ""It's affecting every part of our life, and to me it feels like we're the next Flint, Michigan.""","['jackson', 'problems', 'crisis', 'city', 'water', 'longstanding', 'black', 'mississippi', 'residents', 'johnson', 'womens', 'light', 'brings', 'community']",2021-03-03 02:46:00+00:00
44,"['Bracey Harris', 'Bracey Harris Is A National Reporter For Nbc News', 'Based In Jackson']","The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted childhood in every state, with particularly devastating consequences in the South, where families are most likely to run low on food and struggle with bills and access to online schooling, according to a new report.

Louisiana — where 1 in 4 families lack sufficient food, more than anywhere else in the country — placed as the “worst” state for children during the pandemic, the global nonprofit Save the Children found in its ranking based on U.S. census surveys. It was followed by Mississippi, Texas, New Mexico and Alabama. Minnesota and Utah were the states where children fared the best, with Washington, New Hampshire and North Dakota rounding out the top five.

“Kids and families are suffering all across this country, but there are some communities, and some states, better equipped to navigate through it,” said Shane Garver, senior director of rural education for Save the Children.

To compile the rankings, researchers with the organization analyzed data from Aug. 19 to Dec. 21 from the Census Bureau’s biweekly Household Pulse Survey, which asks participants about their lives during the pandemic, ranging from their employment status to their views on the Covid-19 vaccine. Save the Children’s findings center on food insecurity, internet access for schoolwork and difficulty in paying for basic household expenses.

The disparities are not limited to geography. Forty-one percent of parents making less than $25,000 per year reported not having enough to eat. The report found that children of color were particularly vulnerable to hunger. Nearly 30 percent of Black households and 1 in 4 Hispanic families said they sometimes or often didn’t have enough food to eat, according to the report. That’s nearly twice the figure for white families.

The gulf carries over to education. Tens of thousands of children have not stepped inside of a classroom since last April. Black and Hispanic students are more likely to still be learning remotely. They’re also more likely to have a harder time accessing devices and reliable internet needed for online instruction. Louisiana had the lowest mark last December for the percentage of families able to access online learning, with only 1 in 4 saying they had what they needed to regularly log on.

When schools shut down last spring, Chriscella Metoyer, Save the Children’s Head Start program director for northwest Louisiana, said that at least 60 percent of families served through the program lacked internet, or a device to keep up with their child’s lessons online.

Head Start centers were eventually able to provide tablets to families, but she worries about the struggles her staff can’t account for. Several child care centers in the region have closed, and some families have had a hard time participating in preschool lessons from home.

The hardships have touched Metoyer’s family. Her 22-year-old daughter, Amberlyn, who lives in Natchitoches, was left without work when the day care she worked at shut down for two months. As a single mother with a 4-year-old son, she turned to family for help. When the center reopened, several parents never sent back their children, leaving her with fewer hours. By then, she had learned she was pregnant and decided to stay at home to limit her chances of contracting the virus.

Amberlyn says food assistance and support from her family helped, but she couldn’t always keep up with bills. Then, in mid-September, about a month before she gave birth, she lost her home in an electrical fire.

She’s slowly started over and plans to graduate from college in May, but she worries about Covid-19 numbers going back up and derailing her stability again as she cares for her son and 4-month-old daughter.

“I would feel like I’m back at square one,” she said.

The factors determining many families’ ability to get by were set in motion long before the first case of the coronavirus reached the U.S.

“Before the pandemic, 90 percent of the counties in the U.S. with the highest rates of food insecurity were rural to start with,” Garver said. “So, these were some of the kids, families and communities least prepared. There was the least local investment and local infrastructure to weather a pandemic like this.”

Prior to the pandemic, childhood poverty rates in Louisiana, Mississippi and New Mexico were among the nation’s worst, further fueling hardships families are experiencing now. And it’s not just rural areas — the economic crisis has also hit larger cities across the South.

These circumstances portend a longer road to recovery for communities like Shreveport, Louisiana.

More than 25 percent of residents in the majority-Black city live in poverty.

Omari Ho-Sang, founder of All Streets, All People, a grassroots organization helping to coordinate relief efforts for families in Shreveport during the pandemic, said that the upheaval is the latest in a long list of setbacks, including generational poverty and poor quality of education, that the group has tried to combat.

“We’re hearing stories about folks who are losing their jobs and who are completely dependent on those stimulus checks,” she said. Others don’t have access to bank accounts or move frequently, resulting in checks being mailed to old addresses.

It’s been a tough year to catch a break. A winter storm last month left many in the city without running water. All Streets, All People has distributed bottled water, but it’s not enough to reach everyone. The added expense of purchasing water that’s safe enough to drink is one more hardship.

Ho-Sang worries about how the stress triggered by such events will roll down to children. Emergency rooms across the country have seen an increase in mental health-related visits, and students learning remotely report being more physically affected by stress than their peers attending school in person.

“This pandemic has lasted about a year for us,” Ho-Sang said, “but I think the impact will be 10 years long for children.”","['save', 'struggled', 'children', 'upended', 'covid', 'states', 'lives', 'families', 'food', 'students', 'worries', 'pandemic', 'coronavirus', 'access', 'louisiana']",2021-03-02 07:08:00+00:00

Flake declined an interview request. McCain, who died in 2018, touted the project in a 2014 op-ed in The Arizona Republic, saying that the mine would generate jobs and boost the local economy and that the land would remain open to tribal members and others until the company breaks ground.

The legislation stunned and saddened Naelyn Pike, a San Carlos Apache tribal member who first testified before Congress in opposition to the arrangement when she was 13.

""Our cultural identity is being stripped away from us,"" said Pike, 21, who is Nosie's granddaughter.

""No tree can live without its roots,"" she said. ""And we're that tree.""

Engineer Vicky Peacey, senior manager of permits and approvals for Resolution Cooper, said that the company is sensitive to the tribal members' concerns and that it has already modified its mining plans to leave Apache Leap and hundreds of other special areas untouched.

Peacey said company officials have set up a tribal monitoring program, with dozens of trained monitors from several tribes working alongside archaeologists to identify features of the landscape that hold special meaning. ""Every plant, every animal, water feature, rocks,"" Peacey said. ""It's really helped shape our mining plan.""

Peacey emphasized that the project would employ about 1,500 people and pump about a billion dollars into the economy every year. She also said copper is critical to combating climate change.

Copper is in high demand in the U.S. and around the world, as it is an essential component in such green energy technologies as wind turbines, solar panels and electric cars. The mine beneath Oak Flat is projected to satisfy 25 percent of U.S. demand.

""We have to find a way to balance jobs, economic benefits in these rural communities, as well as environmental protection and cultural heritage preservation,"" Peacey said. ""I think we can do it in this project.""

The mining company plans to extract the copper using a method known as block caving, which over time will cause the ground to collapse and create a pit that the company acknowledges will be nearly 2 miles long and 1,000 feet deep. Oak Flat, along with its petroglyph-covered walls and Apache burial sites, is set to be swallowed up in a crater deep enough to hold the Eiffel Tower.

The project has the support of many who live in the area, including the mayor of nearby Superior.

""We need for this project to move forward,"" Mayor Mila Besich said, citing its economic benefits.

Besich said she didn't understand the ""end game"" of those opposed to the mine.

""That ore body is never going away, so let's figure out a solution,"" she said. ""Let's figure out ways that this becomes a net positive for people, even though we are going to have to sacrifice some special places.""

Others see it differently. The Arizona Mining Reform Coalition has opposed the mine in large part because of concerns over its impact on the area's water supply.

""The real Achilles' heel for this whole project is there's not enough water,"" said Roger Featherstone, the group's director. ""That's something that has just been impossible for us to get anybody to focus on.""

Legal fight

A group of Apaches and other opponents of the mine took the battle to court in January, suing the federal government to halt the land transfer.

The Apache Stronghold group argued in the suit that the planned destruction of Oak Flat would violate religious freedom protections. It also argued that an 1852 treaty between the Western Apaches and the U.S. gives the tribe rights to the site.

""The Oak Flat Parcel of the proposed Resolution Copper Mine Project is located right smack dab in the middle of the Western Apaches' 1852 Treaty lands,"" the lawsuit says. The treaty was ""never amended, rescinded, nor terminated,"" it adds.

In court papers filed the day after President Joe Biden's inauguration, government lawyers argued that Apache Stronghold can't assert ownership rights to the land because the group isn't a federally recognized tribe and that even if it were, the land isn't held in trust for any tribe.

The lawyers, representing the U.S. Forest Service, also asserted that the Apaches faced no immediate harm from the land transfer and that they had failed to show a ""substantial burden"" on their religious exercise.

""In passing the law that created the land exchange, Congress has determined that facilitating copper mining in Arizona and expanding the Tonto National Forest—a forest which services multiple public purposes including providing recreation opportunities and habitat conservation—is in the public interest,"" the government lawyers wrote.

The Apaches have already suffered one legal defeat. The judge denied their emergency request to block the transfer.

U.S. District Judge Steven Logan acknowledged that the mine would ""close off a portal to the Creator forever and will completely devastate the Western Apaches' lifeblood,"" but he said the loss didn't appear to breach religious freedom laws. He concluded that the Apache Stronghold group lacked legal standing because it represented individuals rather than a tribal government.

Apache Stronghold is appealing the decision, and the broader case continues. Two more lawsuits have been filed to block the project.

The Apaches got a rare piece of good news Monday when the Biden administration retracted an environmental impact review of the project. The review, which the Forest Service had released just five days before Biden took office, set in motion a 60-day countdown to the land transfer. The handling of the review had drawn sharp criticism as an attempt by the Trump administration to hobble future efforts to disrupt the project.

The abrupt retraction means the land transfer will no longer take place March 11. The Agriculture Department, which oversees the Forest Service, said in a statement that it wanted to conduct a thorough review of the project.","['sacred', 'land', 'apache', 'tribal', 'company', 'titans', 'oak', 'copper', 'mining', 'apaches', 'row', 'project', 'death', 'flat', 'standoff', 'foreign']",2021-03-03 13:18:00+00:00
