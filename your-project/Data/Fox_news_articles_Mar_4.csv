Andrew Cuomo is facing mounting calls for his resignation, an independent investigation and a move to rescind his emergency coronavirus powers amid dueling scandals over allegations of improper behavior toward women and his handling of the nursing home crisis during the coronavirus pandemic.

""A year into the pandemic, and as New Yorkers receive the vaccine, the temporary emergency powers have served their purpose – it is time for them to be repealed,"" State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said in a statement.

Former Cuomo aide Lindsey Boylan, 36, has accused the governor of unwanted touching and kissing. After her bombshell essay on Medium, another former aide, Charlotte Bennett, also came forward with sexual harassment allegations, claiming she was 25 years old at the time. A third woman with no workplace ties to the governor, Anna Ruch, accused him this week of making unwanted sexual advances and touching her at a 2019 wedding.

A spokesperson for the governor reportedly referred The Times to Cuomo's statement issued Sunday, in which he said some of the things he's said in the past ""have been misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation."" Cuomo's office has also denied Boylan's harassment claims, calling them ""simply false.""

Lawmakers have called for independent investigations and the resignation of Cuomo, 63, including several members of the Democratic party.

Biden called it ""urgently needed"" to protect the right to vote and to ""strengthen"" democracy, and vowed to work with Congress to ""refine and advance"" the legislation.

The For the People Act of 2021, known as H.R. 1, passed Wednesday by a vote of 220 to 210. No Republicans joined with Democrats in approving the bill, H.R. 1.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS PASS EXTENSIVE VOTING AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM BILL H.R. 1

""In the wake of an unprecedented assault on our democracy; a coordinated attempt to ignore, undermine, and undo the will of the American people never before seen in our history; and a new wave of aggressive attacks on voting rights taking place in states across the country, I applaud Speaker Pelosi and the House of Representatives for passing H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2021,"" Biden said in a statement Thursday.

Biden called the right to vote ""sacred and fundamental,"" adding that it is ""the right from which all of our other rights as Americans spring.""

""It will rein in the outrageous gerrymandering that distorts our democracy,"" Biden said. ""It will empower the Justice Department to crack down on laws that curtail voting rights along racial lines. It will reform our campaign finance system to amplify the voices of the people — not the powerful. And it will modernize and secure our future elections against all manner of threats.""

""I look forward to working with Congress to refine and advance this important bill,"" Biden continued. ""And I look forward to signing it into law after it has passed through the legislative process, so that together we can strengthen and restore American democracy for the next election and all those to come.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, said the legislation is needed to combat voter suppression efforts in states, crack down on corruption and diminish the influence of big donors in politics.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS' H.R. 1 WOULD CREATE NEW PUBLIC FINANCING OF CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGNS

The bill would create automatic voter registration across the country and allow felonss who have served their sentences to vote. The bill would also expand early voting and enhance absentee voting by simplifying voting by mail.

The bill would also require more online political ad disclosures and force all organizations involved in political activity to disclose their large donors.

A major pillar of the legislation is setting up a new public financing system for congressional and presidential elections to incentivize small-dollar donations. The legislation would establish a 6:1 match using taxpayer money for each grassroots contribution to a candidate up to $200.

For example, a $200 donation to a House candidate would garner a $1,200 match in public funds for a total contribution of $1,400.

MCCONNELL SLAMS HOUSE DEMS' ELECTION REFORM BILL AS 'WRONG RESPONSE' TO LACK OF FAITH IN ELECTIONS

The public match program would be funded by a new 4.75% surcharge on criminal and civil penalties and settlements that corporations pay to the U.S. government. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated this week the new revenue stream would generate about $3.2 billion over 10 years.

Republicans blasted the public financing provision as a way to line the campaign coffers of members of Congress.

""This bill isn't for the people, it's for the politicians,"" said Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill.

The bill also reaffirms Congress' authority to regulate money in politics, pushing back on the Supreme Court's Citizen United decision.

Meanwhile, the bill seeks to ""fortify ethics law"" by breaking the ""influence economy in Washington"" and increases accountability by expanding conflict-of-interest laws and divestment requirements in an effort to slow the ""revolving door"" and prevent members of Congress from serving on corporate boards.

The bill, also, in a swipe at former President Donald Trump, requires presidents to disclose their tax returns — something Trump did not do while in office.

The legislation would also close loopholes for lobbyists and foreign agents and ensure that watchdogs have ""sufficient resources"" to enforce the law.

Republicans fiercely opposed the legislation—this time around, and during the last Congress when House Democrats first introduced the legislation.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., last week, slammed the legislation as ""exactly the wrong response"" to what he called the ""distressing lack of faith in our elections,"" saying Democrats want to use their ""temporary power"" to ""try to ensure they'll never have to relinquish it.""

14,['Marisa Schultz'],"Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompsom's lone ""no"" vote against H.R. 1, the massive voting rights and election reform legislation, was no accident.

Thompson, of Mississippi, joined with all Republicans late Wednesday to vote against the House Democrats' top legislative priority, known as the For the People Act of 2021.

Thompson's vote was surprising since he was a co-sponsor of the legislation along with the rest of the Democratic caucus. But Thompson said Thursday his constituents weren't supportive of the election overhaul, so he stood with them rather than his colleagues.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS PASS EXTENSIVE VOTING AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM BILL, H.R. 1

""My constituents opposed the redistricting portion of the bill as well as the section on public finances,"" Thompson said in a statement to Fox News. ""I always listen and vote in the interest of my constituents.""

The legislation requires states to establish independent redistricting commissions to carry out the once-a-decade redrawing of congressional districts in an effort to avoid partisan gerrymandering. The bill also establishes a new public financing system for congressional and presidential elections to incentivize small-dollar donations.

The legislation would create a 6:1 match for each grassroots contribution to a candidate up to $200. For example, a $200 donation to a House candidate would garner a $1,200 match in public funds for a total contribution of $1,400.

The election legislation passed by a vote of 220 to 210. No Republicans joined with Democrats in approving the sweeping voter rights reform that now heads to the Senate.

Numbered H.R. 1 to signify it is the top priority of House Democrats, the legislation would also enact automatic voter registration, restore voting rights to felons after they have completed their sentences and expand early voting access and absentee voting.

It also prohibits voter roll purges and partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts, imposes new campaign finance rules, and requires presidential nominees to release 10 years of tax returns.

H.R. 1 would also take aim at big-dollar donors and dark money in politics by requiring additional disclosure of campaign donors and disclaimers on political advertising.

The legislation now heads to the Senate where it has a tough road for passage as the chamber is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans.

15,['Ronn Blitzer'],"Former Vice President Mike Pence offered harsh criticism for a Democrat-proposed voting reform legislation while condemning the Capitol protest on Jan. 6 that, he said, interrupted what would have been a worthwhile discussion of election integrity.

In an op-ed for the Daily Signal published Wednesday, Pence said that H.R. 1, known as the For the People Act, is ""unconstitutional, reckless, and anti-democratic"" because it would take power over elections away from the states.

REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE HITS BACK AT DEMOCRATS' HR 1 ELECTION BILL

""While legislators in many states have begun work on election reform to restore public confidence in state elections, unfortunately, congressional Democrats have chosen to sweep those valid concerns and reforms aside and to push forward a brazen attempt to nationalize elections in blatant disregard of the U.S. Constitution,"" Pence wrote.

Pence supported the need for states to be able to set their own election laws, claiming that ""voting irregularities"" in November's presidential election occurred in large part in states where existing laws had been ""set aside ... in favor of sweeping changes ordered by governors, secretaries of state, and courts.""

Pence claimed that H.R. 1, which Congress is scheduled to vote on later this week, ""would increase opportunities for election fraud, trample the First Amendment, further erode confidence in our elections, and forever dilute the votes of legally qualified eligible voters."" Meanwhile, he said lawmakers should be focused on improving election security and public confidence in the voting process.

MCCONNELL SLAMS HOUSE DEMS' ELECTION REFORM BILL AS 'WRONG RESPONSE' TO LACK OF FAITH IN ELECTIONS

The former vice president said that the existing concern about election security shared by many Americans was why he wanted to ensure that objections to electoral votes at the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress over which he presided ""would be given a full hearing.""

Pence noted that rioting at the Capitol interrupted that process.

""The tragic events of Jan. 6—the most significant being the loss of life and violence at our nation’s Capitol—also deprived the American people of a substantive discussion in Congress about election integrity in America,"" Pence wrote.

Pence cautioned that H.R. 1 would only exacerbate the public's lack of confidence because it ""mandates the most questionable and abuse-prone election rules nationwide, while banning commonsense measures to detect, deter, and prosecute election fraud.""

EVERY HOUSE DEMOCRAT SIGNS ON TO SWEEPING HR 1 BILL, GOP ARGUES IT WOULD 'UNDERMINE' ELECTION INTEGRITY

Those measures include universal mail-in voting, same-day voter registration, ballot harvesting, and automatic registration for people in government databases such as motor vehicle departments – which Pence said would lead to illegal immigrants being registered to vote.

The bill’s sponsor, Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., slammed Pence in response to the criticism, calling him ""Exhibit A of the corrupt status quo in Washington"" that the bill looks to end.

""Most Americans – including a majority of Republican voters – support the core elements of this historic and transformational reform effort,"" Sarbanes said.

The bill does provide for certain security measures, including providing for a ""voter-verified paper ballot"" that voters would be able to inspect before their vote is officially cast and counted.

H.R. 1 could also expand who would get to vote, as it calls for a congressional task force to examine allowing residents of U.S. territories to vote, and discusses statehood for Washington, D.C. It also opposes restrictions such as requiring voter identification or placing conditions on convicted felons before they can regain the right to vote.","['election', 'vote', 'reform', 'elections', 'voters', 'voting', 'confidence', 'prevented', 'laments', 'integrity', 'discussion', 'substantive', 'bill', 'hr', 'rails', 'pence', 'riot']",

Reacting to a ""Fox & Friends"" montage of Psaki saying she would ""circle back"" with various reporters during her six weeks with the Biden White House, McEnany said she had the advantage of knowing where Trump stood on issues.

""I wish Jen Psaki all the best, it is a very hard job but that being said, we took great pains in our administration to do hours and hours of research beforehand, days sometimes,"" she said.

""I always knew where my boss stood. Unlike other press secretaries who maybe didn't have walk-in privileges, I could walk in at any time ... I always knew where his head was at, so I didn't have to a ton of circling back because President Trump gave a lot of access to me.""

McEnany also took a dig at President Biden for staying in the ""basement"" and avoiding press questions. While Biden has occasionally answered questions shouted at him after formal remarks, he has gone 44 days without holding a solo press conference, a record for modern presidents.

""It's exactly like the campaign. That was his strategy all along,"" said McEnany, a new Fox News analyst.

As arrests of migrant children illegally crossing the border have steadily climbed under President Biden's administration, Psaki has repeatedly declined to address the situation as a ""crisis.""

But Psaki has described other issues that way.

The White House press secretary referred to climate change as a ""crisis"" in a past tweet criticizing former Trump on the subject.

""Its not just [COVID-19]...where [Trump] has ignored experts and science...it’s true for the climate crisis too,"" Psaki wrote in May of last year.

Psaki also called gun violence a ""crisis"" in August 2019, thanking the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety for ""putting some [cash] behind ads holding Republicans accountable who won't support"" legislation for background checks and controversial red-flag laws.

A couple of weeks later, the White House press secretary called gun violence a ""crisis"" again and asked former Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke in a tweet to ""take guns,"" saying ""no one needs an assault weapon"" in 2019.

Additionally, Psaki referred to the presidency of Biden’s predecessor, Trump, as an ""existential crisis"" in a 2020 tweet when talking about money from grassroots campaigns in comparison to the money from ""liberal billionaires.""

While Biden followed presidential tradition in proclaiming ""Read Across America Day"" on Tuesday, March 2, Dr. Seuss’ birthday, he bucked his predecessors by leaving out any mention of Dr. Seuss from the proclamation.

6 DR. SEUSS BOOKS TO STOP BEING PUBLISHED BECAUSE OF RACIST IMAGERY

When asked during the White House press briefing Tuesday why the president left out Dr. Seuss, Psaki punted to the Department of Education.

""The proclamation was written by the Department of Education, and you could certainly speak to them about more specifics about the drafting of it,"" Psaki said. ""But read Across America Day, which is, you're right, has not existed forever, has only been around for a short period of time, elevates and celebrates a love of reading among our nation's youngest leaders.""

Psaki said, ""The day is also a chance to celebrate diverse authors whose work and lived experience reflect the diversity of our country, and that's certainly what they what they attempted to do or hope to do this year.""

""And as we celebrate the love of reading uplift diverse and representative authors, it is especially important that we ensure all children can see themselves represented and celebrated, celebrated in the books that they read,"" Psaki continued.

Psaki was asked whether the decision had to do with the controversy surrounding a lack of diversity in Dr. Seuss books, to which she replied: ""Again, I think it is important that children of of all backgrounds see themselves in the children's books that they read.""

""But I would point you to the Department of Education for any more details on the writing of the proclamation,"" Psaki said.

The decision comes after former President Barack Obama and former President Donald Trump both highlighted Dr. Seuss' contributions in their annual proclamations, a Fox News review of White House archives found.

""The works of Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known to us as Dr. Seuss, have sparked a love for reading in generations of students.,"" Obama said in his 2015 proclamation. ""His whimsical wordplay and curious characters inspire children to dream big and remind readers of all ages that 'a person's a person no matter how small.'""

Obama's 2016 proclamation described Seuss as ""one of America's revered wordsmiths"" who ""used his incredible talent to instill in his most impressionable readers universal values we all hold dear.""

Trump, in his 2018 proclamation, urged Americans to ""always remember the still-vibrant words of Dr. Seuss: 'You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.'""

Then-first lady Melania Trump celebrated Read Across America Day in 2017 by reading Dr. Seuss books to hospitalized children.

Meanwhile, the sales of six Dr. Seuss books will cease over racist and insensitive imagery, according to Dr. Seuss Enterprises, which preserves and protects the author’s legacy.

""These books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong,"" Dr. Seuss Enterprises told The Associated Press in a statement.

""Ceasing sales of these books is only part of our commitment and our broader plan to ensure Dr. Seuss Enterprises’ catalog represents and supports all communities and families,"" the statement continued.

BIDEN ERASES DR. SEUSS FROM 'READ ACROSS AMERICA' PROCLAMATION AS PROGRESSIVES SEEK TO CANCEL BELOVED AUTHOR

Copies of ""And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,"" ""If I Ran the Zoo,"" ""McElligot's Pool,"" ""On Beyond Zebra!,"" ""Scrambled Eggs Super!,"" and ""The Cat's Quizzer"" will no longer be published.

The decision to cease publication and sales of the books was made last year after months of discussion, the company told AP.

""Dr. Seuss Enterprises listened and took feedback from our audiences including teachers, academics and specialists in the field as part of our review process. We then worked with a panel of experts, including educators, to review our catalog of titles,"" it said.

Books by Dr. Seuss -- born Theodor Seuss Geisel in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 2, 1904 -- are sold in more than 100 countries.

The ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"" author remains popular, earning an estimated $33 million before taxes in 2020, up from just $9.5 million five years ago, the company said. Forbes listed him No. 2 on its highest-paid dead celebrities of 2020, behind only the late pop star Michael Jackson.

As adored as Dr. Seuss is by millions around the world for the positive values in many of his works, including environmentalism and tolerance, there has been increasing criticism in recent years over the way Black, Asian and other characters are drawn in some of his most beloved children’s books, as well as in his earlier advertising and propaganda illustrations.

The National Education Association, which founded Read Across America Day in 1998 and deliberately aligned it with Geisel’s birthday, has for several years deemphasized Seuss and encouraged a more diverse reading list for children.

A Virginia school system recently decided to discourage recognition of National Read Across America Day in light of the controversy, prompting discussion of the author and decisions to ""cancel"" his work on social media. The school system clarified in a Feb. 27 statement that it is not banning the author's books.

The new TV ads by State Solutions Inc., shared first with Fox News, will run in Maine, Minnesota and Wisconsin. The governors in those states, all first-term governors – Janet Mills, Tim Walz and Tony Evers ‒ are up for reelection next year in races that may be extremely competitive.

MCCONNELL BLASTS DEMOCRATS' COVID RELIEF BILL AS 'WILDLY OUT OF PROPORTION

The ads spotlight an analysis by House Budget Committee Republicans, which estimates that the bill, which conservatives call the ""Biden's Blue State Bailout,"" will cut $155 million from Maine, $805 million from Minnesota and $265 million from Wisconsin — while giving billions in new funding to California and New York, large states controlled by Democrats.

The ads, tailored to each of the three states, ask the Democratic governors and senators in those states to ""stand up"" for their constituents ""and oppose the California and New York bailout bill.""

State Solutions, which works closely with the RGA, wouldn't reveal the dollar amount but told Fox News there’s a ""substantial buy"" behind the spots, which they say will run Thursday through Sunday statewide in Maine, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

""The people need to demand their governors and senators do what is best for their state and stand up to their party bosses in D.C.,"" State Solutions president Dave Rexrode told Fox News.

Rexrode, who’s also RGA executive director, argued that ""taxpayers will be on the hook for this latest COVID package, and now their states will lose millions in COVID relief if these Democrats refuse to stand up to Biden and Pelosi. Families and businesses are already struggling because of COVID, and they are set to face even more challenges if their Governors and Senators don't take a stand against Biden’s Blue State Bailout.""

The massive relief bill was passed last week virtually along party lines by the Democratic controlled House. Debate and the first votes in the Senate – where the Democrats hold a razor-thin majority – is expected to take place on Thursday.

Congressional Republicans are unified in their opposition to the measure, and the portion of the bill that draws the most fire from the GOP is the $350 billion in the package to help cash-strapped states, localities and tribal governments amid an economy flattened by the coronavirus pandemic.

GOP lawmakers, pointing to the ballooning national debt, say the aid is an unnecessary ""liberal wish list"" that would benefit blue states over red states.

""They want to send wheelbarrows of cash to state and local bureaucrats to bail out mismanagement from before the pandemic,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell charged on Wednesday. ""They're changing the previous bipartisan funding formula in ways that will especially bias the money toward big blue states.""

Democrats – as well as a bipartisan group of mayors – strongly support the funding as states and localities deal with a surge in public assistance amid declining tax revenues from the economic shutdown due to the pandemic.

""Funding to keep teachers, firefighters, transit workers, first responders in red states and blue on the job – not a liberal wish list. An American wish list,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer argued Wednesday. ""So many of the people affected by this bill are not liberals or Democrats. They may be Republicans, they may be independents, they may be conservatives. But they're Americans who want some help to get out of this morass.""

""It’s probably not a surprise that Biden’s honeymoon period has closed quickly,"" Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray highlighted. But Murray noted that the president maintains a net positive rating in the new poll, which was conducted Feb. 25–March 1.

An average of all of the latest national polls that measured Biden’s approval rating – compiled by Real Clear Politics – put’s the president’s numbers at 55% approval and 40% disapproval.

Ninety-one percent of Democrats questioned in the Monmouth survey approve of Biden’s performance – basically unchanged since January. Eight in 10 Republicans disapprove, a jump of 10 points from a month ago. Independents are divided – with 43% approving and 48% disapproving. That’s a switch from January, when Biden held a 47%-30% approval/disapproval rating with independents.

But Monmouth notes that the January ""results were a historical high in eight years of national polling by Monmouth. While the current ratings have declined, they remain on the higher end of the range across which they have fluctuated since 2013.""

MEGHAN MARKLE SAYS ROYAL FAMILY 'PERPETUATING FALSEHOODS ABOUT' PRINCE HARRY, HERSELF

""The Royal Household has had a Dignity at Work policy in place for a number of years and does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace,"" the statement concluded.

The source told Us Weekly those close to the couple view the response as ""retaliation"" for their upcoming interview with Oprah Winfrey.

The allegation also came days before the televised sit-down is scheduled to air.

""The accusations of Meghan bullying staff members were mostly the palace and personal aides who were in charge of reminding Harry and Meghan about royal protocols,"" said the source. ""That’s why there was so much tension between Harry, Meghan and the palace aides mentioned in The Times.""

""I don't know how they could expect that after all of this time, we would still just be silent if there is an active role that The Firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us,"" said Markle.

According to The Times, the complaint was first made in October 2018. The complaint alleged that the former American actress drove two personal assistants out of the household and undermined the confidence of a third staff member.

The outlet reported that Knauf submitted the complaint in an effort to protect palace staffers who alleged they were being bullied by Markle. Some claimed they were even reduced to tears.

One royal aide allegedly told a colleague: ""I can’t stop shaking.""

A source alleged that Harry, 36, pleaded with Knauf not to pursue the complaint. However, attorneys for the couple deny that the meeting took place or that Harry interfered with any staff matters.

In the email, Knauf claimed Carruthers ""agreed with me on all counts that the situation was very serious,"" adding, ""I remain concerned that nothing will be done.""

A spokesperson for Markle strongly refuted the claims published by The Times.

""The Duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma,"" a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said in a statement sent to Fox News on Wednesday.

MEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY'S OPRAH WINFREY SIT-DOWN WILL ALSO AIR ON U.K.'S ITV AFTER BIDDING WAR

The sit-down, titled ""Oprah With Meghan and Harry: A CBS Primetime Special,"" will air on March 7. Winfrey, 67, attended their wedding in 2018 and lives near them in Montecito, California.

Markle married Queen Elizabeth II’s grandson at Windsor Castle in May 2018. Their son Archie was born a year later.

Markle and Harry stepped away from full-time royal life in March 2020, unhappy at media scrutiny and the strictures of their roles. They cited what they described as the intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media toward the duchess, who is African American.

It was agreed the situation would be reviewed after a year. On Feb. 19, Buckingham Palace confirmed that the couple will not be returning to royal duties and Harry will give up his honorary military titles — a decision that makes formal, and final, the couple’s split from the royal family.

The pair verified ""they will not be returning as working members of the Royal Family. ""

Authorities believe the information on the luxury SUV’s ""black box"" would show the speed the vehicle was traveling before it crashed.

Biden took a swipe at Republican governors in Texas and Mississippi Wednesday, accusing them of ""Neanderthal thinking"" following their decision to reverse COVID safety policies, including mask mandates.

""We've been able to move that all the way up to the end of May to have enough [vaccines] for every American, to get every adult American to get a shot,"" Biden told reporters from the White House Wednesday. ""The last thing we need is the Neanderthal thinking.""

Despite the warning issued by health officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding a fourth resurgence in coronavirus cases earlier this week, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said all state regulations would be lifted starting Wednesday.

Similarly, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pointed to lower case counts and the increase in vaccine accessibility as justification to revoke all state-imposed coronavirus regulations starting March 10.

BIDEN SAYS TEXAS AND MISSISSIPPI GUILTY OF ‘NEANDERTHAL THINKING’ OVER LIFTING COVID RESTRICTIONS

GOV. ABBOTT: ""The two things, Brian. First, it obviously is not the type of thing that the president should be saying. But, second, he kind of said it on the worst day he could have, because the same day he said that in Texas, the Biden administration was releasing illegal immigrants into our communities who had COVID. The Biden administration was spreading COVID in south Texas yesterday because of their lack of constraint of testing and quarantining people who come across the border illegally. The Biden administration was exposing Texans to COVID. That is a Neanderthal type approach to dealing with the COVID situation.""

..

But, more importantly, with regard to the masks, the change in Texas really wasn't all that much different from where we were before for a couple of reasons. First, we are still strongly advocating that every Texan follow the best practice. Where we are today is completely different from where we were this time last year when Texans and Americans didn't know how to deal with this for an entire year. Texans have learned the best practice, and that is to wear a mask. And we still strongly recommend that people do wear a mask.

And, so, the mask requirement being eliminated isn’t going to make that big of a change in the state of Texas.

25,['Megan Henney'],"More than 16 million Americans will no longer qualify for a third stimulus check under stricter eligibility parameters endorsed this week by President Biden.

That's according to a preliminary analysis published by the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which found that a plan by moderate Democrats to curtail benefits for higher-income earners will cut off cash payments for roughly 11.8 million adults and 4.6 million children.

Under the latest proposal, Americans earning $75,000 or less would still receive the fully promised $1,400 payment. But the checks would phase out faster for individuals at higher income levels than in the version passed Saturday by House Democrats, with individuals making $80,000 a year or more and couples making $160,000 a year, or higher, no longer qualifying for the money.

BIDEN'S RELIEF BILL INCLUDES BILLIONS IN AID FOR STATES THAT DON'T NEED IT

The House version of the bill would also send the $1,400 payments to individuals earning $75,000 or below each year, but the money would phase out slower, with the eligibility cut-off at $100,000 for individuals and $200,000 per year for couples.

That means individuals earning between $80,000 and $100,000, and couples earning between $160,000 and $200,000, are newly excluded from a partial check under the newest plan, which has been backed by the Biden administration.

Although the House bill would benefit more adults — about 91%, compared to the Senate's 86% — both versions would benefit 100% of adults and children who are among the bottom 60% of income-earners in the U.S., according to the analysis.

Stimulus check eligibility emerged as a major point of contention between different ideological factions of the Democratic Party. The party can't afford to lose the support of even a single Senate Democrat, as it needs all 50 members to pass the measure via simple majority with a procedural tool known as budget reconciliation.

SOME FAMILIES COULD RECEIVE UP TO $14,000 FROM BIDEN'S RELIEF BILL

Progressives slammed the decision to tighten eligibility, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez arguing that conservative Democrats have fought so that the Biden administration sends ""fewer and less generous relief checks than the Trump admin did.""

""It’s a move that makes little-to-no political or economic sense, and targets an element of relief that is most tangibly felt by everyday people. An own-goal,"" Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said Wednesday, adding: ""We have a responsibility to show people in this country what a Democratic majority can do for working people.

In a 7-2 decision, Barrett was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh in ruling that the documents were protected by what is known as the deliberative process privilege, even though the conclusions in the drafts ultimately reflected the agencies' final decisions.

""The deliberative process privilege protects the draft biological opinions from disclosure because they are both predecisional and deliberative,"" Barrett wrote, reversing the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling in the case.

While agreeing with the majority that a draft of a draft should be protected, Breyer argued that a draft biological opinion ""is a 'final' document with respect to its content,"" and does not require further deliberation regarding content.

""This bill was named after a man who was murdered by a police officer,"" Cammack began. ""The officer responsible should have never been allowed to don a badge and act on behalf of the agency sworn to protect its citizens. ... As a member of the first responder family, I can say definitively on behalf of our officers, that there is absolutely nothing ... that a good cop hates more than a bad cop.""

Cammack then presented one of her husband's bulletproof SWAT vests to the House floor. The police reform bill would put limitations on military-grade equipment given to state and local law enforcement.

While under investigation, White informed his supervisor that there was another incident, on Nov. 30, 2020, where he used the same racial slur while arresting a juvenile, the department said. The body camera captured White purportedly using the derogatory language twice while effecting an arrest for trespassing.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, then a congressman, reportedly declined a request ahead of his ""fact-finding"" trip by human rights organization Freedom House to bring an aid package, including coloring books and medicine, to the people of the communist dictatorship.

Becerra has previously faced scrutiny for the Cuba trip, which included a meeting with the now-deceased dictator Castro. Upon returning, Becerra refused to call for free and fair elections in Cuba, despite pressure from fellow members of the House Hispanic Caucus, as Fox News previously reported.

The new revelation comes from a 1996 newspaper column by Robert Novak that was resurfaced by the Washington Free Beacon Tuesday.

""The materials they were asked to distribute contained no anti-Castro propaganda but publications as inoffensive as a Christian coloring book for children,"" Novak wrote, referring to Becerra and a Democratic colleague. ""The congressmen themselves did not respond to repeated requests by this column to explain their decision, and their aides said they had no answer.""

Freedom House told the Free Beacon that, while it could not provide records on their specific request for Becerra, it could confirm that their program would use outside people to get aid into the island nation.

Diaz-Balart said he would not contribute membership dues to the caucus until Becerra ""demonstrates minimal respect for the rights of Cubans to be free and calls for free elections for that oppressed island,"" according to the Los Angeles Times.

Becerra later said he could not issue a call for free and fair elections.

""This is an issue that the caucus doesn't take positions on,"" he said, so he could not make a statement, according to The Hill.

Roy Cooper ""take action to protect our state"" after it has emerged that more than 100 illegal immigrants released by the Border Patrol into Texas since late January have tested positive for the coronavirus -- and aren’t being prevented from traveling elsewhere.

The concerns from Republican Rep. Richard Hudson come as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott accused the Biden administration of ""recklessly releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants who have COVID into Texas communities.""

Fox News, citing a spokesperson for the city of Brownsville, Texas, reported Wednesday that 108 migrants there -- since Jan. 25 -- have tested positive for the coronavirus following their arrival.

""In order to protect the safety of our constituents and uphold the rule of law, I am requesting you use all resources available to stop these individuals, place them in quarantine and get them whatever healthcare they may require,"" Hudson wrote in a letter addressed to Cooper, a Democrat.

108 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS RELEASED BY BORDER PATROL IN TEXAS TEST POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS, OFFICIALS SAY

Hudson, in a tweet announcing the letter, linked to Fox News’ story Wednesday, which included reporting from Noticas Telemundo Investiga. Migrant families who spoke to that news organization after testing positive at a bus station in Brownsville -- where the Border Patrol has been dropping them off -- said they were waiting to travel to places such as North Carolina, Maryland and New Jersey.

""On the way, we were wearing a mask all the time, gel, washing our hands,"" Eva Orellana, a 29-year-old from Honduras who came to the U.S. with her 3-year-old daughter and reportedly purchased bus tickets to North Carolina after testing positive, told Noticias Telemundo Investiga. ""Really, I don't feel anything.""

Fox News’ reached out to Cooper’s office for comment.

""It is imperative that you take action to protect our state and I hope you will consider this urgent request as soon as possible,"" Hudson had written to him in his letter.

Felipe Romero, a spokesperson for Brownsville, told Fox News that the 108 positives represent 6.3% of the number of total migrants who have been rapid-tested at the city’s main bus station. The local county-wide positivity rate is estimated to be 13.8%.

Romero added that Brownsville does not have the authority to prevent those who test positive from traveling elsewhere in the U.S. -- and are advising them to quarantine, follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines and socially distance.

Sources at the White House told Fox News on Wednesday it is aware of instances where individuals may continue to travel despite testing positive and being told to quarantine -- yet the federal guidance remains for them to isolate.

Migrants who spoke to Noticias Telemundo Investiga also said they were told of their positive test result by bus station workers, but were not provided any documents noting so. They simply were told to stand in a different waiting area from other individuals, the news organization added.

Abbott is now blasting the Biden administration for the situation that is unfolding.

""The Biden Administration is recklessly releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants who have COVID into Texas communities,"" the Texas governor wrote in a tweet Wednesday night, without elaborating on the statistics. ""The Biden Admin. must IMMEDIATELY end this callous act that exposes Texans & Americans to COVID.""

Abbott made the comments as President Biden accused him of ""Neanderthal thinking"" following the governor’s controversial decision to reverse all coronavirus restrictions -- including mask mandates -- in the state of Texas starting March 10.

33,['Danielle Wallace'],"The self-described ""QAnon Shaman"" -- who garnered widespread recognition after storming the Capitol shirtless, wearing face paint, a bearskin and horned headdress on Jan. 6 -- claimed in a jailhouse interview aired Thursday that police officers ""waved"" him and others into the building on that day nearly two months ago.

Jacob Chansley answered questions from ""60 Minutes Plus"" for an interview first aired on ""CBS This Morning,"" a day before a Washington, D.C., judge is set to hear arguments Friday over his pre-trial release.

Prosecutors argued in a new filing on Monday that Chansley is a danger to the community, explaining he held a speared weapon as he confronted officers inside the Capitol, wrote a threatening note to then-Vice President Mike Pence and spoke about ridding the government of traitors.

'QANON SHAMAN' CHARGED IN CAPITOL RIOT TO GET ORGANIC FOOD IN JAIL

But Chansley categorized his actions on Jan. 6 differently, rejecting the notion that what he did was an attack on this country. He also claimed he remained peaceful after officers ""waved"" him into the Capitol building.

""My actions were not an attack on this country. That is incorrect. That is inaccurate entirely,"" he told ""60 Minutes Plus"" correspondent Laurie Segall, describing instead how he prayed, sang songs inside the building and prevented theft and vandalism.

""I sang a song and that’s a part of Shamanism. It’s about creating positive vibrations in a sacred chamber,"" Chansley said. ""I also stopped people from stealing and vandalizing that sacred space, the Senate. I actually stopped someone from stealing muffins out of the break room. I also said a prayer in that sacred chamber because it was my intention to bring divinity, to bring God back into the Senate.""

Segall pressed him, pointing out that he was not legally allowed to be in that chamber.

""That is the one very serious regret that I have, was believing that when we were waved in by police officers that it was acceptable,"" he said, describing himself as a lover of this country and a believer in the Constitution, the ""truth and our founding principles"" and God.

Chansley also made a distinction that although he regrets entering the Capitol, he does not regret supporting former President Donald Trump -- but he was disappointed not to have received a presidential pardon during Trump's last days in office.

CAPITOL RIOT'S 'QANON SHAMAN' SAYS IN STATEMENT, 'I WAS WRONG'

""I developed a lot of sympathy for Donald Trump because it seemed like the media was picking on him,"" Chansley said. ""It seemed like the establishment was going after him unnecessarily or unfairly and I had been a victim of that all of my life whether it be at school or at home, so in many ways I identified with many of the negative things he was going through.""

""I honestly believed and still believe that he cares about the Constitution,"" Chansley continued, referring to Trump. ""That he cares about the American people. And that’s also why it wounded me so deeply and disappointed me so greatly that I and others did not get a pardon.""

""I regret entering that building. I regret entering that building with every fiber of my being,"" he added.

""But you don’t regret the loyalty to Donald Trump?"" Segall asked. Chansley responded flatly, ""No.""

Authorities have said Chansley was allegedly among the first people to force their way into the Capitol building on Jan. 6, disobeyed orders to leave, refused an officer’s request to use Chansley’s bullhorn to tell rioters to leave the Senate chamber, called Pence a traitor and wrote a note to the then-vice president saying, ""It’s only a matter of time, justice is coming.""

While prosecutors say the spear attached to a flagpole carried by Chansley into the Capitol was allegedly a weapon, his attorney has characterized the spear as an ornament. The defense lawyer also argued the message that Chansley penned to Pence wasn’t intended to be threatening and said his client is suffering from digestive tract difficulties, even though he has been given organic food, as he had requested.

Chansley, who calls himself the ""QAnon Shaman"" and has long been a fixture at Trump rallies, unsuccessfully sought a pardon from Trump. In February, he issued an apology, saying he was wrong for entering the Capitol building on Jan. 6.

He has pleaded not guilty to two felony and four misdemeanor charges. Chansley also made headlines after a judge approved a request that he be given organic food in jail to honor his religious beliefs. He is being held in Washington, D.C., after he was moved from an Arizona jail following his initial arrest.

According to Yahoo Entertainment, Sahin-Collins' competitors Joon Spurney and Tim Everhart each had the same lead going into the Final Jeopardy round, in which contestants wager their winnings on a single question.

The category from the evening was ""European Landmarks"" and the clue was ""Of the principal architects working on it from the mid-1500s to the 1980s, like Pierre Lescot and Hector Lefuel, none were foreigners.""

The question proved to be difficult for all three contestants, with none providing the correct answer — The Louvre Museum. However, what really made viewers’ jaws drop was the fact that, despite not getting the question correct either, Sahin-Collins managed to pull off the win with an intelligent and strategic wager.

While her opponents bet everything they had, she played it safe and wagered $0. As a result, she ended the game with $2,000, the same amount as the second-place contestant, but still earning herself the win.

It didn’t take long before viewers took to social media to commend her on the clever bid.

The documentary film about Thomas, ""Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words,"" was removed from Amazon’s streaming service last month and the filmmaker said he was never given an explanation.

""What Amazon has done is a disservice to anyone—black or white—who is interested in the rich history of black Americans,"" Wall Street Journal columnist Jason L. Riley wrote about the decision.

AMAZON ACCUSED OF ‘ABSURD AND UNACCEPTABLE’ CENSORSHIP AFTER BOOK QUESTIONING TRANSGENDER MOVEMENT VANISHES

The film features extensive interviews with Thomas and chronicles his journey from ""the depths of poverty"" to the Supreme Court and everything in between, including his contentious confirmation hearings where Anita Hill accused him of sexual harassment.

President Joe Biden, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the hearings that riveted the nation, grilled Hill in archival footage used in the film. The films does not paint Biden in a positive light; Thomas told viewers at one point he had ""no idea"" what Biden and other Senate questioners were talking about.

Thomas spoke on everything from race and politics to religion in the documentary. It aired on PBS back in May 2020 and landed on Amazon later that year.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Filmmaker Michael Pack told the Wall Street Journal he was never offered an explanation as to why Amazon removed it.

""Our distributor, who’s the one who made the deal with Amazon, has repeatedly asked them for explanations but they haven’t given any,"" Pack told the Journal.

""They have the right to pull anything from their site, and they don’t have to give an explanation,"" he continued. ""So it’s not a contract violation. But many people have complained, and they haven’t put it back up.""

A search of Amazon Prime for ""Created Equal"" turns up a 2017 movie by the same name about an attorney suing the Catholic Church, a 1980 television series ""Free to Choose,"" ""Anita: Speaking Truth to Power"" about Hill and ""Confirmation,"" a 2016 HBO movie about Hill's accusations.

Amazon’s online retailer still lists the DVD for ""Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words,"" but notes it is currently out of stock.

The removal of the film irked Pack, especially because it happened during Black History Month. Thomas is the second African American to serve on the Supreme Court and its only current Black member.

""Clarence Thomas, to my mind, is the most important African-American leader in America today,"" Pack told the Journal. ""I don’t think Amazon should get away with doing these things without suffering at least some PR consequences.""

Last month, the book, ""When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,"" was also removed from Amazon.

The decision caused swift backlash, as critics pointed out Amazon has a history of censoring books that don’t coincide with the company’s political views.

Lightfoot and Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown on Wednesday outlined changes designed to prevent a repeat of the scene in February 2019 at the home of Anjanette Young, starting with a ban on all ""no-knock"" warrants except ""in specific cases where lives or safety are in danger,"" they said.

VICTIM OF BOTCHED CHICAGO POLICE RAID SUES CITY, OFFICERS

Also, search warrants that now require the approval of a lieutenant will have to be approved by someone ranked deputy chief or higher, and a female officer must be on the scene whenever search warrants are served, officials said.

An unnamed informant gave police Young’s address, saying a man was illegally possessing a gun there. In a video of the raid released in December, which was first reported by local CBS 2 Chicago, a naked Young repeatedly tells officers they have the wrong home and that there are no guns in the apartment. She had returned home after work and was undressing for bed when police barged into her home.

Under the proposed policy, officers will be required before a search warrant is executed to, according to the news release, ""conduct a planning session ... to identify any potentially vulnerable people"" who may be inside. Also, the policy will require an independent investigation to make sure the information used to obtain the warrant is accurate.

VICTIM OF BOTCHED CHICAGO POLICE RAID CANCELS MEETING WITH LIGHTFOOT AFTER PARTIES CAN'T AGREE TO TERMS

Young’s attorney, Keenan J. Saulter, said in a statement provided to Fox News that the city’s proposal ""falls woefully short.""

""CPD’s raid of Ms. Young’s home is not an anomaly,"" Saulter continued. ""[I]t is just one egregious example of a documented pattern of illegal, violent and dehumanizing raids that have traumatized thousands of Black and Brown families, for which CPD has failed to hold a single officer to account.""

Saulter said ""nearly 3,000 of CPD’s approximately 6,800 home raids"" from 2016 to 2019 did not yield a single arrest.

EMAILS SHOW CHICAGO MAYOR KNEW OF 'BAD' BOTCHED RAID IN NOVEMBER 2019

""What’s more, CPD fails to even track or document when a wrong raid has taken place, thereby allowing officers to continue this practice and protecting these grave violations from being brought to light,"" Saulter said.

Saulter also said Lightfoot's proposal does not include provisions in an ordinance introduced last month by aldermen, including one that would prohibit officers from pointing guns at children.

Just last month, Young sued Chicago and a dozen CPD officers for allegedly engaging in a conspiracy to cover up civil rights violations. All 12 officers have been placed on desk duty pending the outcome of a Civilian Office of Police Accountability investigation and the city's top attorney resigned shortly after the video became public.

At a press briefing on Wednesday, Brown and Lightfoot said the new policy will be posted as a draft on the police department's website for 15 days so the public can comment on it. Lightfoot said she hopes the final policy will be implemented by the end of the month.

Lightfoot has come under intense criticism for the way she and the city responded to the botched raid at Young's home. During the several minutes she was allegedly not allowed to dress, the social worker tearfully told officers who continued to search the home that they were at the wrong address.

Chicago's law department initially tried in court to keep the video from being made public. Then, when WBBM-TV aired the video from Young’s home late last year, Lightfoot said she was only then learning about the video. She acknowledged later that she received a detailed email about the video a year earlier.

On Wednesday, Lightfoot reiterated what she said at that time, saying: ""The fact of the matter is that trust was, no question, shaken.""

""He kept saying these guys provide this for you. ... He was mentioning, ‘We have donors talking about pulling out money from the south end zone [stadium addition project], stopping their donations,’"" he said.

Del Conte denied to the paper any such comment was made, telling the Texas Tribune in a statement that he never heard from any alumni or donors about their furor over the ""Eyes of Texas"" issues. He added that he was ""happy"" to talk to anyone to let them know ""this is not true.""

Herman has not commented on the issues.

Former defensive back Caden Sterns alluded to the issues in a tweet Tuesday.

""My teammates and I got threatened by some alumni that we would have to find jobs outside of Texas if we didn’t participate,"" he wrote.

The Texas Tribune published emails showing donors and alumni threatening to rescind their contributions to the school if the players didn’t acknowledge the spirit song.

Texas president Jay Hartzell released a statement defending players.

People who target our students with hateful views do not represent the values of the Longhorn community,"" Hartzell said in a statement. ""A few extremist views in the sample of emails the Texas Tribune reported on do not speak for the 540,000 proud Longhorn alumni who actively support our students and university. Out of the many emails I received this fall, a very small number included comments that were truly abhorrent and hateful. I categorically reject them, and they bear no influence on any aspect of our decision-making.

Equipped with a common set of facts, we will then continue the conversation about our song. Having spoken to students and faculty on the committee, I truly believe we can be a model for how communities address complex problems and move forward together.""

""The Eyes of Texas"" has been accused of having racial undertones and was a source of controversy for Texas throughout the season amid a summer of racial tension in the U.S. Scrutiny over the song revealed that the title was taken from a favored saying by a former school president who was mimicking Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and the song was performed in the 1900s by musicians in blackface at minstrel shows.

During the 2020 season, the band at one point refused to play the song and some players refused to stay out on the field while the song played.

In January, when new head coach Steve Sarkisian was welcomed at his introductory press conference, he said the song would remain a part of the culture with him in charge.

Thirteen people suffered non-life-threatening injuries in the crash that happened in the eastbound lanes of Interstate 10 near Eloy – a city around 65 miles southeast of Phoenix – on Wednesday. Five were transported to a local hospital.

At the time of the wreck, there were dusty conditions, gusting winds and brush fires burning through parts of the area.

NATIONAL FORECAST: SPRING-LIKE, WARM TEMPERATURES ARE HERE, WHILE PARTS OF US SEE FIRE DANGER

Zero-visibility dust storm conditions also hindered the efforts of first responders and the Eloy Fire District crews to assist those involved, according to AZFamily.

The lanes, which were closed due to the crash, have since been reopened, Arizona's Department of Transportation said.

The National Weather Service issued dust and wind advisories in multiple counties through the evening.

""Winds this strong can make driving difficult, especially for high-profile vehicles. In addition, strong winds over desert areas could result in briefly lowered visibilities to well under a mile at times in blowing dust or blowing sand. Use extra caution,"" a National Weather Service advisory said.

A wind advisory means sustained wind speeds between 30 and 40 miles per hour or wind gusts between 40 and 58 miles per hour; parts of Arizona observed wind speeds of 40 miles per hour or more than 50 miles per hour.

Pinal County was also under an air quality warning, according to Fox 10 Phoneix.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport was forced to halt some flights for a period of less than 90 minutes.

In addition, excessive wind temporarily knocked out power for approximately 6,000 people, according to The Arizona Republic.

Much of the state was under a red flag warning amid possible fire conditions and low humidity, and The Republic noted that the high temperature in Phoenix registered over 85 degrees for the first time in 2021.

Brown's son, Michael Brown Jr., an 18-year-old Black teen, was killed in a police-involved shooting in the city in 2014, prompting a wave of Black Lives Matter demonstrations. Despite the protest movement's massive haul, Brown said he received just $500.

""His son's death and the unrest that followed brought global attention to the police brutality issue that has plagued the U.S. for over a century,"" the IBFA said in a statement Tuesday. ""[Brown Sr.] was left with more questions than answers about the group's funding.""

""Today, we hold Black Lives Matter accountable,"" Russell said in a video Tuesday alongside the elder Brown. ""What kind of movement are we building where we're saying, 'Black Lives Matter,’ but the freedom fighters and the families are being left behind?""

The International Black Freedom Alliance claimed that local activists have not been properly funded amid the surge of donations to Black Lives Matter.

""They believe the momentum from the 2014 unrest and the subsequent protest that local activists organized for several months after were the catalyst for the group being propelled into the position to receive the $90 million,"" the International Black Freedom Alliance wrote in a press release Tuesday. ""Now they demand funding from the group to the tune of $20 million in order to continue the work they started.""

Russell said the $20 million would go toward annual commemorations of Michael Brown Jr.'s life, mutual aid programs, Black Panther-style services, as well as fellowships and stipends to fight White supremacy.

Black Lives Matter received a flood of donations in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died while in the custody of Minneapolis police last May.

The Associated Press reported last month that Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, the umbrella organization for the movement, brought in just over $90 million last year and ended 2020 with more than $60 million in cash.

The group said it has committed $21.7 million to Black Lives Matter chapters and other Black-led organizations, according to the Associated Press, and several chapters were notified that they are eligible for a $500,000 grant through a spinoff called BLM Grassroots.

BLM chapters around the country banded together to reject the proposal in December though.

A New Yorker was in for a spooky surprise when she went hunting for the cause of a draft — and found an abandoned apartment behind her bathroom mirror.

Samantha Hartsoe has rocked TikTok with a shocking tour of the disturbing discovery, in a four-part video saga posted to the platform on Wednesday and Thursday. Hartsoe’s first clip announcing the alarming news has been viewed 7.5 million times.

""I'm in my New York Cirty apartment, and it's cold. It doesn't matter how high the heat goes, I'm cold,"" she explained. Tracking the draft into her bathroom, Hartscoe said she felt cold air flowing from a notch in the doorway. Searching, she realized the cold air was coming from the mirror.

""And I realize the mirror moves,"" Hartscoe said, shocked.

In the second clip, the New Yorker removes the mirror to reveal an unfinished room on the other side.

Showing the sight to two friends, her pal named John wondered ""What if someone's living in there right now?""

""The weirdest part about this is that they didn't fill it in on either side of this hole,"" Hartscoe said. ""I have to go in, and figure out what is on the other side of my bathroom.""

Gearing up in a face mask, gloves and sneakers — plus a flashlight on her head and self-defense hammer for good measure — she hopped through the hole in the wall, as seen in the third clip, which was posted Thursday morning.

In the final video, Hartscoe wandered around the ""whole other apartment,"" albeit an unfinished one that didn't look quite up to code. Inside, she found trash bags and a water bottle as the only apparent ""signs of life.""

""It's freezing in here!"" she said. She also took the opportunity to lock what appeared to be the front entrance of the abandoned apartment.

The video then fast-forwards to Hartscoe back at home, where she proudly declares she ""made it out alive!

Regardless, the Palace released a statement announcing that it would be conducting an investigation into the allegations.
