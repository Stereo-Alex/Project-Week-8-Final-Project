Elaine Cromie for The New York Times The economy continues to slowly rebound from the worst of the pandemic, but claims for unemployment benefits remain high by historical standards, a sign of how long it will take for the job market to recover fully. Initial jobless claims rose last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday, after a big drop in the previous week. A total of 748,000 workers filed first-time claims for unemployment benefits in the week that ended Feb. 27, 32,000 higher than the week before. In addition, 437,000 new claims were filed for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federal program covering freelancers, part-timers and others who do not routinely qualify for state benefits, a rise of 9,000. Neither figure is seasonally adjusted. On a seasonally adjusted basis, new state claims totaled 745,000, an increase of 9,000. Claims are lower than they were when coronavirus cases spiked early last year. With the virus easing since then in many places, some restrictions on business activity have been rolled back. That has helped the job market somewhat. The increase in claims last week included a big jump in Ohio and Texas, as the latter recovered from severe winter storms last month. “We knew there was some backlog in Texas and claims would likely go back up,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at the forecasting firm Oxford Economics. “Despite expectations for record-breaking growth in 2021, the job market is still quite fragile.” Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said Tuesday that the state was lifting all restrictions on business and eliminating its mask requirement, moves that drew criticism from President Biden. Elsewhere, officials have been more cautious — in Chicago, parks and playgrounds reopened, while in Massachusetts, capacity restrictions on restaurants have been lifted. “The labor market is continuing to gradually improve,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. “Job growth will accelerate, perhaps as soon as the second quarter, with decent gains in leisure and hospitality and travel.” Even so, the number of new filers remains extremely high by historical standards, a sign of just how entrenched the pandemic remains one year after it first struck. “We are still dealing with millions of unemployed Americans,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. “It’s going to take a long time to get back to normal, but job growth will be stronger as we head into the spring.”

Why the markets are stressed at the prospect of an economic rebound. The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, has said the central bank would not cut support for the economy anytime soon. Credit... Pool photo by Susan Walsh The market conniptions of recent days are a direct result of several developments that point to the brightening prospects of economic recovery. Vaccinations are rising, retail sales and industrial production have been surprisingly solid and, perhaps most important, the Biden administration is expected to push its $1.9 trillion stimulus plan through Congress in the coming days. One clear consequence is expected to be strong growth. Wall Street economists now expect output to rise by nearly 5 percent in 2021. Such robust growth — it would be the best year for the economy since 1984 — would seem like a good thing for stocks. But growth brings with it the possibility of rising inflation, which in turn could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates — and that’s what investors are reacting to, with different consequences for the stock and bond markets, Matt Phillips reports for The New York Times. Few economists see a significant risk of runaway inflation, but investors say that the mere possibility of painful price growth might drive the Fed to raise interest rates to tamp down the economy. That would be bad for bond owners. If the Fed raised rates, rates around the bond market would climb. Then the price of bonds that investors hold would have to fall until they produced yields that were comparable to the new, higher rates in the market. In expectation of that, investors are demanding a higher return now in the form of a higher yield on their bonds. Higher rates can be a problem for the stock market’s performance. One reason is that high interest rates make owning bonds more attractive, coaxing at least some dollars out of the stock market. Higher rates can also make borrowing more expensive for companies, especially smaller ones that have potential but lack a track record of profitability.

The United States suspends tariffs on Scotch whisky and other British products. The United States will suspend retaliatory tariffs of up to 25 percent on Scotch whisky while British and U.S.officials seek to resolve a trade dispute. Credit... Denis Balibouse/Reuters The United States will suspend retaliatory tariffs against Britain for four months, including on Scotch whisky, arising from the longstanding trade dispute about subsidies for Boeing and Airbus. The two governments said they would use the time to try to come up with a long-term solution to the trade disagreement. Since Britain left the European Union, it has sought to forge its own trade policy and secure a free-trade deal with the United States. On Jan. 1, the British government ended its retaliatory tariffs on Boeing and other goods, which were imposed by the European Union, in an effort to smooth over its relationship with the Biden administration. The decision essentially separated Britain from the dispute about aircraft subsidies between the European Union and United States. (That said, the U.S. trade representative argued Britain did not have the legal standing to keep imposing these tariffs outside the bloc.) The tariff suspension is expected to help several types of British exporters, especially the Scotch whisky industry. In October 2019, a 25 percent tariff was placed on Scotch whisky and exports to the United States have since dropped 35 percent, costing companies more than £500 million (about $700 million), the industry’s trade group said. Cashmere and Stilton cheese producers will also benefit, the government said. The decision “shows what the U.K. can do as an independent trading nation, striking deals that back our businesses and support free and fair trade,” Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, said in a statement. The suspension “will allow time to focus on negotiating a balanced settlement to the disputes, and begin seriously addressing the challenges posed by new entrants to the civil aviation market from nonmarket economies, such as China,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and British Department of International Trade said in a joint statement.

Stocks on Wall Street fall for a third day as bond yields climb again. Yields on long-term bonds climbed on Thursday, sending stocks on Wall Street sharply lower. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.54 percent, from 1.49 percent on Wednesday. Rising government bond yields have rattled tech stocks especially hard over the past few weeks because they have been some of the biggest gainers over the past year, partly supported by the Federal Reserve’s easy money policies. The S&P 500 was down 0.6 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was down 1.2 percent. The market volatility has actually been caused by good news: an economic rebound, which investors worry will cause inflation. Few economists see a significant risk of runaway inflation, but investors say that the mere possibility of painful price growth might drive the Fed to raise interest rates to tamp down a heated economy. And that would be bad for bonds. Despite policymakers mostly brushing off the worries, more investors think the Fed might have to intervene. To address these worries, the Fed could buy the long-dated bonds where yields are rising or put in place a policy of yield curve control. In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.4 percent, and London’s FTSE 100 lost 0.3 percent.

Square acquires majority of Tidal, Jay-Z’s streaming service, in $297 million deal. What did Jay-Z and Jack Dorsey talk about when they went yachting around the Hamptons together last summer? Perhaps only Beyoncé knows. Maybe now we do, too. Square, the mobile payments company led by Mr. Dorsey, announced on Thursday its plan to acquire a “significant majority” of Tidal, the streaming music service owned by Jay-Z and other artists — including Beyoncé, Jay-Z’s wife, and Rihanna, who is a client of Jay-Z’s entertainment management company, Roc Nation. Square will pay $297 million in stock and cash for the stake in Tidal. Jay-Z will join Square’s board. Image Jay-Z in 2015. Credit... Sam Hodgson for The New York Times Image Jack Dorsey in 2018. Credit... Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters The announcement comes less than two weeks after Jay-Z announced that he would sell 50 percent of his champagne company, Armand de Brignac — better known as Ace of Spades — to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton amid a downturn in the entertainment industry caused by the pandemic that has affected some of Jay-Z’s holdings. “I think Roc Nation will be fine,” Jay-Z said in an interview last month about the sale of Armand de Brignac. “Like all entertainment companies, it will eventually recover. You just have to be smart and prudent at a time like this.” Also last month, Mr. Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Twitter, announced that he and Jay-Z had endowed a Bitcoin trust to support development in India and Africa. Tidal, which Jay-Z bought in partnership with other artists in 2015 for $56 million, provides members access to music, music videos and exclusive content from artists, but the streaming music industry has been dominated by competitors like Spotify, Apple and Amazon. In 2017, Jay-Z sold 33 percent of the company to Sprint for an undisclosed amount. (After a merger, Sprint is now a part of T-Mobile.) Earlier this week, Jay-Z bought back the shares from T-Mobile, and most will be sold to Square as part of the deal. Mr. Dorsey and Jay-Z began to discuss the acquisition “a few months ago,” said Jesse Dorogusker, a Square executive who will lead Tidal on an interim basis. “It started as a conversation between the two of them,” he said. “They found that sense of common purpose.” Mr. Dorogusker said Square, which was founded in 2009, will offer financial tools to help Tidal’s artists collect revenue and manage their finances. “There are other tools they need to be successful and that we’re going to build for them,” he said.

OPEC and Russia agree to keep a lid on oil production, sending prices higher. Saudi Aramco’s Ras Tanura oil refinery and terminal in Saudi Arabia. Saudi officials volunteered to cut oil production by one million barrels a day at the last OPEC meeting. Credit... Ahmed Jadallah/Reuters The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies decided on Thursday to keep a tight rein on production, sticking with its current quotas for April with some exceptions. The news from the group known as OPEC Plus caused a jump in oil futures. Brent crude was up by almost 5 percent, to $67.24 a barrel. The outcome represents a win for Saudi Arabia, which had counseled against raising production because recovery from the pandemic is still uncertain. “The right course of action is to keep our powder dry,” said Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the Saudi oil minister at the beginning of the group’s meeting on Thursday. “Let us be certain that the glimmer we see ahead is not the headlight of an oncoming express train.” Russia, which has been pushing hardest for increases, will be allowed a small boost of 130,000 barrels a day while Kazakhstan was granted a 20,000 barrel a day boost. Before the meeting, some analysts said the market was already in balance and that there was room for additional production without undermining prices. After collapsing last spring, oil prices have risen to pre-pandemic levels in recent weeks. Vaccination programs against the coronavirus are gathering pace, potentially leading to increased economic activity and greater demand for oil this year. In addition, production growth from shale producers in the United States is expected to be restrained this year. Petroleum heavyweights that are curtailing production, like Russia and the United Arab Emirates, would like to put some of that oil back on the market. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, continues to urge caution while apparently seeking even higher prices. After January’s OPEC meeting, Saudi Arabia voluntarily agreed to cut its own production by one million barrels a day, to about 8.1 million barrels a day. That cut had been scheduled to expire in April, but on Thursday Saudi officials said they would continue it for at least another month. The outcome of Januarys meeting was an unusual compromise that allowed modest increases by Russia and Kazakhstan. Once again, the group has reached a somewhat awkward deal, figuring that despite disagreements it is better to present at least a facade of unity.

Disney plans to close a significant portion of its stores this year. Disney will close 30 percent of its stores in North America this year. Credit... Joshua Lott for The New York Times After 33 years as a shopping mall mainstay, Mickey Mouse is mostly calling it a day. The Walt Disney Company said on Wednesday that it would dramatically downsize its chain of Disney Stores, which have struggled amid the pandemic and a broader consumer shift to online shopping. At least 60 locations in North America — 30 percent of the Disney Store footprint in the region — will close this year. The company described the closures as the “beginning” of its downsizing effort. A significant number of overseas stores are also expected to close. According to its 2020 annual report, Disney has about 60 stores in Europe. The Disney Store chain was founded in 1987 and once numbered more than 1,000 locations worldwide. For a time in the early 1990s, during a boom for shopping malls, Disney even experimented with an adjacent spinoff chain of Mickey’s Kitchen restaurants, where items included Dumbo burgers, Pinocchio pizzas and fries shaped like Donald Duck. Disney redesigned many Disney Store locations in 2017 in an attempt to boost business, incorporating live video feeds from its theme parks and shifting the merchandise mix away from toys and toward fashion-conscious young adults. Results were mixed. In 2019, as shopping malls continued to struggle, Disney expanded its merchandising presence at Target stores, a move that analysts viewed as the beginning of the end for the stand-alone Disney Store business. ShopDisney, the company’s online store, will expand over the next year and become more integrated with Disney’s theme park apps and social media platforms, according to Stephanie Young, president of Disney Consumer Products, Games and Publishing.

1,"['Dionne Searcey', 'Benjamin Rasmussen']","The pandemic, which has driven down the price of coal, oil and gas, has only heightened the urgency for Wyoming to resolve an identity crisis over whether to let go of one of its richest assets: emissions-spewing fossil fuels. Officials are planning for devastating budget cuts in a state that some economists describe as suffering from a “resource curse,” a term often used for developing nations that underperform economically despite having an abundance of natural resources.

“The old joke in Wyoming is all you need to use to go coal mining is a three-iron. People were told that coal will always be here, that these are lifetime jobs,” said Rob Godby, an economist at the University of Wyoming. “We’re at a crossing the Rubicon moment — it went from ‘It’s never going to happen’ to ‘Now it’s happening.’”

In the midst of this economic despair, Carbon County, on the edge of the Red Desert, ended last year as one of only three counties in the state with budget surpluses, largely thanks to tax revenues from wind projects.

“If it wasn’t for wind farms, we’d be in terrible shape,” said Mr. Weickum, who recently became mayor of Rawlins, the windiest city in the state by some measures and the Carbon County seat.

The high desert landscape with vistas that stretch to the horizon makes Wyoming one of the best spots in the nation for wind. Some of the strongest, most regular gusts in America blow down from the Rocky Mountains, so fierce that freeway signs flash with warnings of gales of more than 60 miles per hour, so strong they yank sideways at cars and trucks driving down the interstate.

Wyoming’s ample wind will keep the blades spinning on the immense new project near Rawlins, featuring perhaps as many as 1,000 turbines. It’s being built by a company tied to the billionaire Philip Anschutz and could produce enough electricity to power about 1 million homes.","['county', 'coal', 'wind', 'desert', 'knows', 'state', 'rawlins', 'yank', 'blowing', 'wyoming', 'budget', 'way', 'carbon']",2021-03-03
2,['Frank Decaro'],"With names like Vigor Mortis, Spikey Van Dykey, Jack Rabid and Freddie Prinze Charming, the latest drag kings were being nurtured in out-of-the-way venues in cities around the world, ones not unlike those clubs of the ’90s. In New York, performance collectives like Brooklyn’s Switch ’N Play, led by the burlesque-inspired “sex symbol” K. James; Night Gowns, a series of events run by Sasha Velour, a “Drag Race” winner; and Cake Boys, out of Queens, have been fertile ground.

Typically, younger performers blur whatever is left of gender lines. As Mr. Grrrl put it, “Right now, if you don’t have an ‘AFAB performer,’” — a cisgender woman dressed as a drag queen — “or a drag king in your lineup, you’re doing it wrong.” The future of drag, he said, “is going to be a big old mess and that’s a wonderful, glamorous, fantastic thing. We’re all finding new ways to spread joy through the power of sequins.”

When Damien D’Luxe, a 34-year-old drag king in Minneapolis, takes the stage, he may mime a medley of “Hooked on a Feeling” and “Crocodile Rock” dressed as Captain Hook. But he does so wearing high-heeled boots and false eyelashes that Bianca Del Rio would kill for. He has been known to wear a powdered wig and floppy lace cuffs straight out of Falco’s 1986 MTV video for “Rock Me, Amadeus” while lip-syncing to “The Barber of Seville” in Italian.

When you’re a drag king, it can take that much effort to get noticed.

“More kings are recognizing that passing as a dude, although that takes a lot of work and dedication and talent, isn’t getting the spotlight,” Mr. Cider said. “The kingdom has evolved into vivid colors and costumes and headpieces and glitter because that’s how you stand out in a crowd.” Especially, he said, when you’re on a bill with a gag-worthy gaggle of 7-foot-tall drag queens.

“We can’t compete in the Glamazon department,” said Wang Newton, 42, an Asian-American New York drag king who, in his act, tests the boundaries of political correctness while wrapped in vintage Vegas swagger. But that doesn’t mean drag kings can’t compete. “We’re not about death drops. We’re our own thing,” Mr. Newton said. “It’s a whole new bag and we can explore that now.”

And an increasing number of performers are doing so.

“I’m watching girls and performers of all genders who maybe five years ago would have gone into burlesque who now are seeing drag kinging as the ultimate art form,” Mr. Grrrl said. “It’s a very interesting space to be in. Masculinity is something that deserves to be made fun of.”","['rule', 'ready', 'thats', 'takes', 'york', 'mr', 'performers', 'thing', 'youre', 'kings', 'drag', 'king']",2021-03-04
3,['Anthony Tommasini'],"One of his tricks involved playing “Fisher’s Hornpipe” with one hand and “Yankee Doodle” with the other, while singing “Dixie.” He could repeat political speeches he had heard months before, mimicking the vocal cadences of the speaker, even in foreign languages unknown to him.

There are countless testimonies to his fathomless skills, even if they often reek of paternalistic or white supremacist attitudes. During a tour to Europe when Wiggins was 16, he won praise from major musicians. The composer and pianist Ignaz Moscheles deemed him a “singular and inexplicable phenomenon.” The Norwegian violinist Ole Bull, though insisting that Wiggins was no prodigy in the traditional sense, described him as a “marvelous freak of nature.” Mark Twain followed Wiggins’s career for years.

Though his talents were astonishing, Wiggins’s concerts became outlandish spectacles. He had a habit of gyrating and moving his body spasmodically while performing, and even while being promoted as the “Wonder of the World,” many described him as an “idiot,” even an “imbecile.” (It is possible that he was on the autism spectrum.)

Very little of his enormous earnings went directly to him. Gen. Bethune signed a contract with an ambitious promoter. After emancipation, Wiggins remained essentially an indentured servant to Bethune, who eventually became Wiggins legal guardian.","['bethune', 'wonder', 'born', 'stardom', 'yearsthough', 'won', 'white', 'described', 'achieved', 'world', 'wiggins', 'slavery', 'wigginss', 'yankee', 'musical']",2021-03-03
4,['Jessica Winter'],"When Grace Hopper, the trailblazing computer scientist and U.S. Navy rear admiral, was 7, she tried to figure out how her alarm clock worked by taking it apart. Still unsure after the thing was in pieces, she broke down another clock and then another. She eventually wrecked seven alarm clocks by the time her mother noticed what she was doing.

My son’s timepiece of choice is battery-operated wall clocks. I often find their metal entrails artfully scattered on the living-room floor, evoking the occult rock arrangements in “The Blair Witch Project.”

But if he ever attains the bona fides of Grace Hopper, he will have other childhood origin stories to choose from. There’s the time he disassembled our apartment’s doorbell, leaving behind a peephole in the door that he argued should be left intact, “for the fresh air.” Recently, when I was speaking on an evening Zoom panel, I cut out midsentence when he attempted to reroute the Internet connection using Magna-Tiles.

And he’s only 4.

My son explores his world by dismantling it. Hand him a child-size screwdriver and he can remove several light switch plates and begin unburdening a door of its hinges before you have time to reconsider your options. One morning after I’d grabbed a quick shower, I entered his bedroom to find he had removed the mattress from his bunk bed and propped it against a wall in order to examine how the bed was constructed.

5,['Joyce Cohen'],"For a dozen years, Ryan Michele Woods and Jeffrey Lee Woods rented a two-bedroom apartment in a two-family house in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, facing Green-Wood Cemetery.

The ground-floor unit had a deck and a paved backyard. “Our landlords didn’t raise our rent” — $2,100 a month — “as long as we kept up with improvements,” Ms. Woods said.

When Isaac, now 5, was born, the couple added a temporary wall to section off the main bedroom’s alcove. When they had to find space for Ruby, now 2, they moved their own sleeping quarters to the office off the kitchen.

They suffered through the surrounding noise and a sheet-metal shop behind them. “We could see the future,” Mr. Woods said. It was loud and claustrophobic — and that was before the pandemic arrived.

The time had come to find a new home, preferably a house with plenty of space and a layout suitable for a family of four and pets, plus a yard and a parking spot.

[Did you recently buy or rent a home in the New York metro area? We want to hear from you. Email: thehunt@nytimes.com]

Ms. Woods, 41, grew up on Staten Island, left for college in Boston and returned to Brooklyn. She is now an English teacher at the same Park Slope middle school that she attended, where her mother also taught. Through a common friend, she met Mr. Woods, 52, who is from Florida and joined the Coast Guard when he was young, later working in film.

With their budget, up to $700,000, they knew their new home would not be close to Windsor Terrace. Over time, they had watched as older residents died, investors flipped houses, and buyers priced out of other Brooklyn neighborhoods arrived. “The middle class got pushed out,” Ms. Woods said.

6,['Claire Cain Miller'],"The pandemic has been distinctly difficult for women, particularly mothers — Vice President Kamala Harris this month called their job losses a “national emergency.” Women are already at a disadvantage in pay and promotions. Their progress in the labor force, decades in the making, may have been erased by the recession.

Mothers were much likelier than fathers to leave work because of school closures and caregiving responsibilities, and a variety of data shows that they are doing significantly more of the additional child care, education and housework during the pandemic.

Now, as more have returned to paid work, they are adding to the unpaid work they are already doing at home: “When we say moms are catching up to dads, that says nothing about how hard it is,” Ms. Heggeness said.

When lockdowns began last spring, the exodus of mothers from paid work was fast and large. By April, nearly half of mothers living with school-aged children weren’t working. Unemployment remains high. But there could be a few reasons more mothers are working now.

The analysis looked at whether parents had a job or not, but not at how many hours they worked, so some mothers might have returned to part-time or gig jobs that paid less than they earned before.

They might have been more able to work as parts of the country began to reopen after the lockdowns. In some places, their children returned to school in the fall, or their employers reopened.

Also, after the initial, acute stage of the pandemic passed, they might have made new child care arrangements so they could earn a paycheck.","['job', 'burdens', 'shouldering', 'work', 'mothers', 'regaining', 'jobs', 'paid', 'school', 'pandemic', 'working', 'women', 'lockdowns', 'returned']",2021-03-04
