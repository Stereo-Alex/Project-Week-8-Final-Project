0,['The Economist'],"A FTER THE Depression and the second world war, voters and governments in rich countries recast the relationship between the state and its citizens. Now the pandemic has seen the old rules on social spending ripped up. More than three-quarters of Americans support President Joe Biden’s $1.9trn stimulus bill, which is due in the Senate and includes $1,400 cheques for most adults. And in the budget on March 3rd Britain extended a scheme to pay the wages of furloughed workers until September, even as public debt hit its highest level since 1945 (see article). Such boldness brings dangers: governments could stretch the public finances to breaking-point, distort incentives and create sclerotic societies. But they also have a chance to create new social-welfare policies that are affordable and which help workers thrive in an economy facing technological disruption. They must seize it.

The past year has seen a wild experiment in social spending. The world launched at least 1,600 new social-protection programmes in 2020 (see article). Rich countries have provided 5.8% of GDP on average to help record numbers of workers. Government debts are piling up, but so far low interest rates mean that they are cheap to service. The public’s mood had already been shifting. Britons used to grumble that layabouts sponged off the welfare state; now they are more likely to say help is too stingy. Last year over two-thirds of Europeans said they supported a universal basic income ( UBI ), an unconditional recurring payment to all adults. Affluent professionals have had their gaze drawn to the working conditions of those who deliver food and look after the sick. The struggles of women who have dropped out of the workforce to care for children and the elderly have become impossible to ignore.

The social safety net in many rich countries was creaking before covid-19 struck. Modelled on the ideas of Otto von Bismarck and William Beveridge, it had often failed to cushion workers from globalisation and technological and social change. In 1999-2019 the number of Americans aged 25-54 outside the labour force grew by 25%, or 4.7m, over six times more than the number who received help from the main assistance programme for displaced workers. As health-care and pension costs soared in recent years, governments cut back support for working-age people. Between 2014 and 2018 Britain’s state-pension bill grew in real terms by £4bn ($5.8bn), even as the rest of its welfare budget shrank by £16.5bn. A dwindling share of middle-income jobs and the growth of the gig economy fuelled fears that labour markets were changing faster than flat-footed governments could.

With the public and some economists cheering on, it is tempting for politicians to stoke the economy with more ad hoc spending, or put in place vast schemes such as UBI . Instead they need to take a measured, long-term view. The safety net must be affordable. Tight budgets, not milk and honey, will define the 2020s. The annual deficit of big advanced economies was 4% of their combined GDP even before the pandemic—and much ageing is still to come. Already bond yields are rising again (see article). Social spending must flow quickly and automatically to those who need it—not, as in America, only during crises when a panicked government passes emergency legislation. And governments need to find mechanisms that cushion people more effectively against income shocks and joblessness without discouraging work or crushing economic dynamism.

The first step towards satisfying these goals is to use technology to make ancient bureaucracies more efficient. Postal cheques, 1980s mainframe computers and shoddy data need to be relegated to the past. In the pandemic many governments temporarily short-circuited their existing systems because they were too slow. In Estonia and Singapore digital-identification systems and a disdain for form-filling became an asset in the crisis. More countries need to copy them and also to ensure universal access to the internet and bank accounts. The call for efficient administration may sound like tinkering but one in five poor Americans eligible for wage top-ups fails to claim them. Nimbler digital-payment systems will reduce the need for costly universalism as a fail-safe, and allow better targeting and quicker response times. Digital systems also permit the emergency option of making temporary cash payments to all households.

That is the easy part. Balancing generosity and dynamism is harder. Part of the solution is to top up the wages of low-paid workers. Anglo-Saxon countries have done this well since reforms in the 1990s and 2000s. But wage top-ups are of little use to the jobless and are often scant compensation for people who lose good jobs to forces beyond their control. Paltry support for the unemployed in Britain and America preserves incentives to work but at high human cost. The sparsity of social insurance has undermined political support for creative destruction, the catalyst for rising living standards. Continental Europe tends to underwrite traditional workers’ incomes more generously. But the distortion of incentives leads to higher unemployment and divisions between coddled insiders and a precariat. Both sides of the Atlantic lack a permanent safety net that insures gig workers and the self-employed.

There is one country that combines labour-market flexibility with generosity: Denmark, which spends large sums—1.9% of GDP in 2018—on retraining and on advising the jobless. These interventions stop the unemployed from falling into dependency. The inadequacies of policies elsewhere are often glaring. Britain’s efforts have flopped. America’s comparable spending is less than a 20th as large as Denmark’s, even though the few lucky beneficiaries of its “trade-adjustment assistance” earn $50,000 more in wages, on average, over a decade.

Bungee economics

For years social spending has favoured the elderly and an outdated safety net. It should be rebuilt around active labour-market policies that use technology to help everyone from shopworkers who are victims of disruption to mothers whose skills have atrophied and those whose jobs are replaced by machines. Governments cannot eliminate risk, but they can help ensure that if calamity strikes, people bounce back.■

Covid-19 has transformed the welfare state. Which changes will endure? (Mar 2021)

Might the pandemic pave the way for a universal basic income? (Mar 2021)

You can also listen to The Jab, our new podcast on the race between injections and infections, and find trackers showing the global roll-out of vaccines, excess deaths by country and the virus’s spread across Europe and America.","['support', 'century', 'net', 'postcovid', 'countries', 'governments', 'world', 'workers', 'need', 'spending', 'systems', 'safety', 'welfare', 'help', '21st', 'social']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
1,['The Economist'],"“S UDDENLY EVERYTHING drops out from under you,” says Will, a 30-year-old Londoner. He has had paid jobs in arts marketing since he graduated from university. The pandemic upended everything. Redundancy loomed. Rescue came in the form of the British government’s furlough scheme, without which he would be jobless and penurious. The experience has made him more supportive of the welfare state—and even of grander schemes, such as a universal basic income ( UBI ).

Crises, such as wars or economic collapse, reveal societies’ strengths and weaknesses, and change thinking about how they can and should be organised. The pandemic has forced a re-evaluation of the social contract, in particular how risk should be divided among individuals, employers and the state. The covid-19 fiscal stimulus packages have made even the interventions of the global financial crisis seem like minnows. The expansion of the welfare state has been the greatest in living memory. Government bail-outs of citizens, rather than banks, could mark a new chapter in its history.

At its most basic, the welfare state provides some form of social security and poverty relief. In 1990 Gosta Esping-Andersen, a political scientist, identified three models: market-oriented in Anglophone countries, where the state plays a “residual” role; family-oriented in mainland Europe, where the state and employers play a supporting role; and state-oriented for the Scandinavians, with universal protections and services. The balance between state, market and family shifts over the course of people’s lives, but most take out about as much as they put in (in any year 36% of Britons receive more than they pay in taxes, but over their lifetimes only 7% do).

When covid-19 struck and economies locked down, entire industries faced obliteration. Since the start of the pandemic countries have announced over $13.8trn (13.5% of global GDP ) in total emergency funding, more than four times the support provided during the financial crisis. Rich countries have done almost all the spending (see map). Only in 1945, as Europe was rebuilt after the second world war, was government debt as a share of GDP so high. Emerging economies have never borrowed as much.

The shape of the welfare state has been transformed, too. Established principles such as means-testing (welfare only for the poorest), social insurance (only for those who paid in) and conditionality (only for those who do something) went out of the window. Governments wrote near-blank cheques for everything from job guarantees to food. Some simply sent cash.

As the pandemic abates and economic recovery beckons, how much of this expansion will last? The shift in risk in 2020 came after decades during which risks such as living longer than expected, or being replaced by an algorithm or foreign worker, were gradually offloaded from governments and employers onto individuals. And just as a flood increases demand for flood insurance, the millions reliant on the state for the first time are demanding stronger safety-nets.

Covid-19 showed that the welfare state needed modernisation. It was born in a different social order, and to protect against different risks. Discontent was rising before the pandemic: in 2019 less than one in five people in 26 countries agreed that “the system” was working for them and half said that it was failing, according to the Edelman Trust Barometer. That governments had to respond so aggressively to covid-19 shows that the responsibility for some risks sat in the wrong place. In a new book about the social contract, Minouche Shafik, the head of the London School of Economics ( LSE ), predicts that “The political turmoil we observe in many countries is only a foretaste of what awaits us if we do not rethink what we owe each other.”

American social security emerged from the Great Depression. Social-insurance programmes appeared in Europe at the turn of the 20th century. But it was the second world war that led to the birth of the modern European welfare state, with universal benefits to guard against poverty and provide health care and education.

Before the war, welfare had primarily been understood as poverty relief through redistribution. But the bombs hit both rich and poor, and Europe emerged with a new appetite for something different, and larger: shock relief for everyone through insurance. Nicholas Barr of the LSE describes this as part of the “piggy bank” objective of welfare: the realisation that even if poverty were eradicated, people still need protection against shocks and periods of dependency over their lifetimes.

The post-war expansion ended with the stagnation and inflation of the 1970s. A new version of the welfare state focused on getting people into jobs. Benefits were made scarcer and stingier to discourage laziness and dependency. Work incentives were boosted. Welfare recipients were stigmatised as “scroungers” and universalism gave way to means-testing and conditionality. America replaced many cash benefits for the jobless with tax credits for the working poor. Britain renamed unemployment benefits “Jobseeker’s Allowance”. The labour market was made more flexible to entice employers to hire. With full employment, fewer people would need benefits, went the thinking.

Most countries used this second phase which started in the 1980s to reduce state intervention and shift risk back to individuals. Unions were successively weakened, and employment protections cut back still further. In the private sectorthe certainty of defined-benefit pensions was replaced by the uncertainty of the defined-contribution kind. Between 2004 and 2018 the share of real income replaced by a typical mandatory pension for a private-sector worker fell by 11% in rich countries on average. The social-housing stock as a share of total housing decreased, rent controls were trimmed and housing costs went up.

Don’t think twice

But talk of self-sufficiency ended when covid-19 struck. Governments scrambled to get the money out and ask questions later. The result was a huge increase in the number and generosity of safety-net measures. By January the International Labour Organisation counted over 1,600 social-protection policies launched since February 2020. Record numbers claimed support. In some rich countries as many as 60% of those getting help during the pandemic, including through furlough schemes, had never received welfare payments before, according to BCG , a consultancy.

The IMF estimates that by January rich economies had increased total direct spending by almost 13% of GDP , about half of it on supporting workers and households. Countries that typically spend a lot on social protection spent comparatively less on emergency funding (see chart). Support for employment, such as wage subsidies or furlough schemes, was most popular in Europe (including Britain). In the OECD , a club of mostly rich countries, over one in five employees have had their job rescued by such programmes.

Governments have spent about the same on supporting households through bolstered unemployment benefits, child benefits and cash transfers. In America, which has favoured such spending over wage subsidies, the $600 weekly increase in unemployment insurance meant two-thirds of recipients earned more on the dole in the first months of the pandemic than they had when they were working. Claims soared: nearly 33m were made in the third week of June, compared with 2m in the last week of February, just before the pandemic struck, and 12m in the peak week of the financial crisis. In Britain the government increased universal credit, the main welfare programme before the pandemic, by £1,000 ($1,290) a year. Some 6m people claimed it in January compared with 2.6m last February. Britain, like others, snipped some of the strings attached to such benefits and broadened eligibility. Many also doled out cash. Donald Trump’s administration sent cheques for $1,200 and then $600 to most adults last year. President Joe Biden plans to distribute another $1,400, taking the price tag of the policy to $920bn. In Japan every citizen received ¥100,000 ($930). The pandemic highlighted the outmoded pattern of some welfare spending: designed to fit a mid-skilled worker of a type that has become rare, and is likely to become rarer still. It exposed the vulnerability of the growing group of labour-market outsiders, and how little job and income security many essential workers enjoy.

They say every man needs protection

Economists were already arguing for the need to plug coverage gaps, especially for the one in four workers in OECD countries in temporary work or self-employed. Over the past 20 years rich countries’ labour markets have become polarised, with growing shares of low- and high-skilled jobs and falling shares of middle-skilled (and -income) jobs. Before the pandemic hit, a higher share of people were in work than at the turn of the century, but most of the growth has been in part-time jobs. Bureaucratic, inflexible welfare systems were already showing the strain before the shock of the pandemic made changes that had seemed politically unfeasible look not just possible but necessary.

When Margaret Hope, a self-employed chef in Canada, lost all her work due to covid-19 last March, she immediately began selling her kitchen equipment. “Here we go again,” she thought, “I’ll get nothing.” After Alberta’s oil-price crash in 2014 she had received no government support and had to close up. But this time the federal rescue package covered the self-employed. An emergency monthly benefit of C$2,000 ($1,580) was paid to those who earned less than C$1,000 per month between March and September. Some 8.9m Canadians received it—nearly a quarter of the population—at a cost of C$82bn.

Other governments took similar action. America, for the first time, expanded unemployment insurance to freelancers and contractors. Several extended the coverage of sick leave. The public interest in a universal benefit had rarely been clearer.

The vulnerability of workers with family responsibilities became acutely clear when schools closed. In America one in four working women considered cutting their hours or quitting. Public support for better child-care provision is now more bipartisan. The pandemic put child-care policies on the table even in places where it had been overlooked, for example in Italy. Some governments, such as Australia’s, made child care free for a time. Others, including Portugal’s and Germany’s, provided cash for carers and increased child benefits. Mr Biden has proposed a temporarily enhanced child tax credit (a policy which would, almost on its own, halve poverty among children). “There is total commitment…from the entire Democratic caucus to make this permanent,” says Sherrod Brown, a Democratic senator from Ohio.

The pandemic also underscored the importance of speed to welfare. Analysis by McKinsey, a consultancy, suggests that the magic “troika” of reaching lots of people, quickly and with little fraud was possible only for countries with advanced financial infrastructure, meaning widespread use of digital payments, digital ID s and—crucially—relevant data, such as tax returns, linked to these ID s. Singapore, which has all three, was able to send wage subsidies to eligible employers automatically.

Other countries had to make trade-offs between speed and fraud, or between scope and successful delivery, says Anu Madgavkar of McKinsey. Ms Hope, the chef, was “gobsmacked” to receive her money within days of applying online. Most Canadians got their payments within a week. Canada decided to prioritise speed and ask questions later (it has now started asking recipients to prove their eligibility).

Technology was not the only deciding factor in governments’ ability to act with agility; simplifying the claims process proved as important, for example by dropping burdensome tests on assets or assessments of partners’ incomes.

Ensuring that social spending is flexible is crucial, not just in a pandemic. When people know there is a safety-net, they may take healthy risks, such as starting a business. If it takes new applicants for out-of-work benefits months to get their money, they may be less keen on jobs that they might later lose. Distributing cash quickly in a crisis can help smooth consumption and lessen economic contraction.

Swift action has had remarkable success. Households’ incomes in rich countries were largely protected even as GDP tumbled. In April, as the unemployment rate more than tripled, American real disposable income rose by 15.6%, a record. History suggests that increases in social spending rarely disappear entirely after a crisis. The question is what will stick.

Many countries seem to have passed the peak of their emergency social spending, as economies begin to recover. Across the OECD take-up of furlough schemes has fallen, from a high of 20% of employed people in May to around 5% in September. In America claims for unemployment benefits have almost halved since their peak, and the unemployment rate dropped from 14.8% in April to 6.3% in January.

Some support programmes, such as Britain’s furlough schemes, have been extended. Others are being wound down. Australia is no longer providing child care free, and its “coronavirus supplement” will end this month (to be replaced with a smaller permanent increase in jobseeker’s allowance of A$25 ($20) per week).

Such changes are driven primarily by fiscal necessity. Government debt is piling up to record highs. Tax revenues have fallen. Governments worry that overgenerous benefits are themselves a disincentive to taking paid work and can lock people into a “welfare trap”. And yet even before covid-19, public opinion had been moving in favour of the state, and employers, taking more of the risk away from individuals. In 1987, 30% of Britons thought welfare recipients did not deserve benefits; by 2019 this had fallen to 15%, according to the annual Social Attitudes survey. The proportion who think benefits are too high and discourage work has fallen from 59% in 2015 to 35%. In America only 56% of people surveyed in 2009 by Pew, a pollster, were in favour of the Obama administration’s $800bn stimulus package, whereas 88% supported the Trump administration’s $2trn covid-19 package last year. “It’s rather extraordinary how there’s been all this spending, even sending people cash, and the public has basically accepted it,” says Rachel Lipson, at Harvard University. The pandemic seems to have shifted the mood from targeting towards universalism. Some claim that, taken to their logical conclusion, the lessons from covid-19 will lead countries to roll out UBI (see article). Direct cash transfers, perhaps even universal ones, could become a standard part of governments’ emergency tool-kits. But no country is seriously contemplating a full-blown UBI scheme.

When the winds of change shift

More likely is a renewed appreciation of governments’ role in pooling and underwriting risks, in particular those that insurers call “uninsurable”. The pandemic has demonstrated the extent to which governments can smooth shocks. On the two days in April when the largest group of Americans received their stimulus cheques, spending by low-income households shot up by 26 percentage points, to near pre-pandemic levels, according to research by Raj Chetty of Harvard University and colleagues. Several economists have argued that the pandemic has shown why the generosity of benefits should be pegged to the state of the economy, with welfare acting as a shock absorber when times are toughest.

A revamped welfare state could provide enough flexibility to encourage work but still step in when disaster strikes. It will need to invest in human capital. The pandemic has accelerated ongoing changes in the structure of the economy. “Buffering alone won’t be enough to fight future shocks,” cautions Anton Hemerijck of the European University Institute. “You have to invest in child care, in skills, in health, in people as well if you want to future-proof the welfare state.” The impact of climate change, technological innovations and demographic shifts on jobs and livelihoods is hard to predict. But further social disruption is almost certain. Better preparations cannot start soon enough. ■

2,['The Economist'],"IT WAS, the wags of Twitter noted, the quickest relaunch of a SpaceX rocket yet. SN10, the latest prototype of the next-generation rocket, Starship, with which the company’s boss, Elon Musk, hopes to send people to Mars, took off from the company’s facility in Boca Chica on the Texas coast at 5.15pm local time on March 3rd. Six minutes and 20 seconds later, returning from an altitude of around 10km, it set itself back onto its landing pad, the first of the three prototypes to have attempted this test flight to achieve touchdown without blowing up.

Or, at least, without doing so promptly. Eight minutes after landing, an explosion at its base threw the rocket into the sky again—this time blown into fiery pieces. But the spectacular coda should not diminish the fact that although the Starship programme may not achieve its goals quite as rapidly as Mr Musk would like, it is making real progress towards creating a fully reusable launch system more powerful than the Saturn Vs used in the Apollo missions.

The company’s Falcon 9 rockets, which have made it the world’s leading satellite-launch company, distinguish themselves from the competition in part by having reusable first stages. Having pushed the second stage out of the atmosphere and to a fair fraction of orbital speed, these first stages—hollow metal pillars the height of a 14-storey building—return to Earth, landing either close to their launch pads or on barges in the ocean. Starship is to be the reusable second stage of a much bigger system. With six Raptor engines, a new design providing more than twice as much thrust as the Merlins used on the Falcon 9, it will be launched into space by a reusable first stage, the “Super Heavy” booster, with 28 of the same engines.

SN10, like its predecessors SN9 and SN8, was equipped with only three Raptors, and got nowhere close to orbit. But it got high enough to test one of the technologies which Starship will need and Falcon lacks. The Falcon first stage relies on its engines to slow it down as it returns, vertically, to Earth; the Super Heavy will, in time, do much the same. But Starship, which will return at higher speeds, will need to use the atmosphere as a brake. SN10 tried this out by twisting around after it had finished its vertical ascent so as to fall back towards the Earth in a belly flop, with the fins at its base and the canards mounted just behind its nose cone keeping it level and pointed the right way. Less than two kilometres from the surface it relit its engines, flipped itself vertical again, turned two of the engines off and used the remaining engine to set itself down. The landing was not quite as soft as anticipated, leaving the rocket with a distinct tilt, and flame was visible at its base after the last engine had turned off. Damage sustained in landing may well have accounted for the subsequent explosion.

One of the unusual aspects of the Starship’s development is the rate at which it gets through prototypes. SN10 was already assembled and sitting on the pad when SN9 met its fiery end on February 2nd. SN11 is expected to roll out of the building in which it is being assembled soon. Mr Musk says that SN15, already under construction, will include significant upgrades. That may mean a capacity for supersonic flight and for climbing beyond the atmosphere.

This is all happening very quickly, by the standards of aerospace development schedules. But it will still take time. Mr Musk had at one point talked of getting Starship to orbit last year. When Maezawa Yusaku, a Japanese billionaire who has a contract with SpaceX for a mission that would take him and a crew of eight around the Moon on a Starship, says he plans to make the trip just two years from now he seems hopelessly optimistic. But SpaceX is not short of money; a recent round of financing brought $850m in new investment, valuing the company at $74bn. Though some of that will go into expanding the company’s vast constellation of Starlink satellites, designed to provide broadband connectivity worldwide, some will doubtless flow to Boca Chica, allowing further prototypes to pass new milestones—and doubtless providing a few more entertaining explosions along the way.","['stage', 'musk', 'companys', 'dust', 'used', 'starship', 'progress', 'bites', 'reusable', 'making', 'rocket', 'spacex', 'landing', 'engines', 'falcon']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
3,['The Economist'],"The past two American presidents thought they were too involved with the Middle East, but the Middle East refused to let them go

B ARACK OBAMA tried to pivot to Asia, but the Arab Spring, Syrian civil war, Islamic State and Iran’s nuclear programme kept dragging him back. For all the noise Donald Trump made about ending the “forever wars”, he edged towards war with Iran. He dispatched 14,000 troops to the region and, in the end, did not much change the sprawling American military commitment there. Now, even more than his predecessors, President Joe Biden is signalling an intention to downgrade the Middle East among America’s priorities.

He took so long to make his first phone call to the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, that his spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, felt compelled, in response to a reporter, to declare the president meant no “intentional diss” (as though an unintended oversight might not be even more humiliating). Mr Biden finally placed the call on February 17th, almost a month after his inauguration. He waited another week to call King Salman of Saudi Arabia, just before his administration declassified a report accusing the king’s son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, of approving the operation that resulted in the dismemberment of a journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.

Mr Biden, who promised during the campaign to make Saudi Arabia “the pariah that they are”, disappointed many of his supporters by not punishing the crown prince. But he is not looking to further roil the Middle East by threatening America’s long-standing alliances. Instead, he wants the allies to learn to expect a new detachment from the Americans.

Mr Biden has frozen a shipment of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia and has also ordered a review of weapons sales to the United Arab Emirates. He has shown little interest in chasing peace between Israelis and Palestinians, a grail pursued by the past five presidents. His defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has begun a review of American deployments that is expected to consider a shift from the Gulf. “That’s a lot for leaders in the region to digest,” said Martin Indyk of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was Mr Obama’s special envoy to Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

And yet it comes as little surprise, given the shift in thinking of left-leaning Middle East experts. Mr Indyk, a former ambassador to Israel who devoted much of his career to seeking peace, published an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal last year on which the jaded headline summarised an emerging consensus: “The Middle East Isn’t Worth It Anymore”.

This view holds that America’s core interests in the region—protecting Saudi oil and the state of Israel—are diminishing as concerns. America still has an interest in the stability of the global oil market, but it imports more oil from Mexico than from Saudi Arabia and fracks plenty of its own. Israel, the only nuclear power in the region, is not in existential peril. Further, the Middle East is now riven less by an Israeli-Arab divide than a Sunni-Shia one, with Israel lined up alongside Sunni Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, against Iran.

In the magazine Foreign Affairs last year, Jake Sullivan, now Mr Biden’s national security adviser, and Daniel Benaim, now the deputy assistant secretary of state for Arabian Peninsula Affairs, wrote that the shift in interests did not mean America “should leave the region outright”. But skilful diplomacy, they concluded, “will ultimately allow for sustained military reductions”.

Yet a familiar obstacle is blocking the exit: Iran. Among Mr Biden’s first orders of business—unfinished business, for many members of his foreign-policy team—is to curb Iran’s nuclear programme and contend with its proxies, starting in Yemen.

The agreement to constrain Iran’s programme, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was among the proudest foreign-policy achievements of the Obama administration. Mr Trump called the deal “horrible and laughable” and in 2018 he pulled out of it, reimposing sanctions which had been dropped or waived. He went on to impose further sanctions, in what he called a campaign of maximum pressure.

Even as Iran’s currency collapsed and covid-19 raged, the country responded with “maximum resistance”. It began enriching more uranium, and to greater purity, than allowed by the deal. It has also violated the agreed terms on its use of centrifuges. Today Iran stands closer to being able to build a nuclear bomb than it did when Mr Trump left the agreement, though it continues to insist it wants to use nuclear power only for civilian purposes.

The Biden administration has said it is willing to restart negotiations alongside the same allies. But at the end of February Iran rejected the idea of face-to-face talks with the Americans unless they commit themselves in advance to lifting some sanctions. Administration officials say Iran must comply with the agreement before they will relieve any sanctions.

Each side believes the other wants to restore the deal, and both are manoeuvring to discover which wants it more. Presidential elections in Iran in June may create some deadline pressure, since at a minimum installing a new government, which is expected to be more hard-line, would interrupt and delay any negotiations.

This argues for a busy period of diplomacy in the spring. “I’ve seen this movie before,” said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group ( ICG ), an NGO based in Brussels. He recalled that before the original deal each side also insisted that the other must move first. He added, “When I look at the cast of characters in this administration, I can’t imagine they’d let the agreement collapse on their watch.” Until recently, Mr Vaez’s boss at the ICG was Rob Malley, a veteran of Middle East negotiations under Bill Clinton and Mr Obama. Mr Malley, who also helped achieve the original agreement, is now Mr Biden’s special envoy for Iran.

Shortly before Mr Malley left the ICG , it issued an unsigned report describing steps America should take to return to the deal. These include a commitment from the Biden administration to support an emergency loan from the IMF sought by Iran to cope with the pandemic, followed by a negotiated timetable for Iran to reverse its breaches of the accord. America would provide some sanctions relief each time the International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran had rolled back a violation, in a process that might take two to three months.

Centrifudge

Then, after a new Iranian president has taken office, America and its allies could pursue what the administration calls a “longer and stronger” follow-on agreement. Such a deal might exchange economic normalisation for long-term guarantees of the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme and limits on its ballistic missiles. Though some Biden officials had argued for attempting first to strike the fuller deal, that debate appears to have been resolved in favour of the incremental approach.

Renewing nuclear diplomacy with Iran, Mr Biden’s advisers believe, would create a basis for America to press for talks among regional powers to end their proxy conflicts. The Americans want to begin with Yemen, where Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have been fighting the Saudi-backed government for seven years. Yemen weighs on the consciences of many Biden officials because of support the Obama administration gave to the Saudi-led effort. The Trump administration intensified that support, and today the United Nations regards Yemen as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

Mr Biden has appointed an envoy to push for peace in Yemen, and there are hints of progress, at least among the outside powers. The combatants themselves, however, have yet to show much interest in halting the fighting.

According to the vision of Mr Sullivan, the national security adviser, a new framework for regional powers to address their differences, together with nuclear diplomacy, would allow America to begin to pull back. The Middle East, he and Mr Benaim wrote in Foreign Affairs, is “the world’s most dangerously under-institutionalised region”, with nothing like the African Union or the Organisation of American States to police norms.

Any effective regional organisation is a long way off. If anything, would-be members seem more inclined than ever to go their own ways. The UAE last year normalised relations with Israel and last month put a spacecraft into orbit around Mars, while Egypt, preoccupied with its economic woes, has vanished from its historic leadership role. Saudi Arabia and Iran retain strong interests in preserving enmity between the United States and Iran, since the former—like the UAE and Israel—benefits from the costly protection of American forces, while the Iranian regime derives legitimacy from its standoff with the Great Satan. Add on the crisis in Yemen, the suppurating wound that is Syria, the precarity of Iraq, the assertiveness of Turkey and a building humanitarian and human-rights disaster in Ethiopia: Mr. Biden will have to pay more attention than he would like to the neighborhood if America has any hope, however thin, of someday paying it less.

Or else he will have to embrace the role of ruthless realist, and walk away. His treatment of the Saudi crown prince—shaming him but not punishing him, respecting the regime but urging reform—looks like an attempt to split the difference. And already a familiar, violent pattern is asserting itself: last week America dispatched F -15 fighters to drop bombs in eastern Syria on facilities used by Iraqi militias linked to Iran, in response to rocket attacks by Iran-backed groups against Americans in Iraq. Mr Biden said he meant to warn Iran to “be careful”.

American administrations find it easier to talk about shifting their attention from the Middle East than to do so in practice, says Senator Chris Murphy, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “There’s always a crisis,” says Mr Murphy. “There’s always something new and exciting happening in the Middle East. Whereas China’s trajectory is slow and quiet and steady.”■

4,['The Economist'],"H ONG KONG’S Central district has long housed the offices of the world’s poshest law firms. Recently a few of them, such as Baker McKenzie, Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, and Freshfields, have left for parts of the city with cheaper rents. Central still teems with lawyers, except that more now toil for mainland firms like Zhong Lun, JunHe Law Offices and Fangda Partners.

These are members of the so-called Red Circle of elite Chinese practices that increasingly compete with London’s venerable Magic Circle (of which Freshfields is one) and New York’s white-shoe partnerships. And not just for office space. They are poaching legal eagles from Western rivals, or merging with them to create large groups such as Dentons (Dacheng in Mandarin). And they are opening outposts across the globe. The overarching aim, supported by authorities in Beijing, is to offer Chinese lawyering alongside other professional services, such as accounting, consulting and investment banking.

Chinese firms have so far made little headway in the City or on Wall Street. A study last year of 1,400 cross-border deals between 2010 and 2018 that involved at least one Chinese party, by Li Jing of Tilburg University in the Netherlands, showed that only 3% of law firms hired in China by American companies were Chinese. One reason may be cultural. From the West’s wood-panelled boardrooms the Red Circle can look like arriviste apparatchiks. James William Freshfield, that firm’s eponymous founder, died in 1864. Wei Xiao, who in 1989 launched JunHe, China’s first law partnership, only recently stepped down as managing partner. Like Mr Wei, who used to work at the justice ministry, many founding partners came from Beijing’s officialdom. They speak its parlance and view the world through its lens. Their names often reflect traditional virtues.

Culture is not the whole story, however. For Chinese companies, too, have often preferred to retain Western counsel. Ms Li’s research found that only one in six law firms hired by Chinese groups to help with foreign transactions were Chinese; nearly two in five were American. Even for inbound investments only about half of firms retained by Chinese companies were local. State-owned enterprises were less likely still to hire home-grown firms.

A bigger reason for the Red Circle’s low profile is lack of experience in common law, which underpins much of international commerce. As Western companies globalised in the 1970s they brought their legal advisers with them, spreading the influence of British and American law firms. Many cross-border contracts are still inked in the common-law entrepots of Hong Kong, London, New York or Singapore.

Part of Chinese law firms’ effort to catch up with the Anglo-Saxons involves learning the rules of the old order, says Liu Sida of the University of Toronto. Hence the expansion in Hong Kong. In 1998 just one of Hong Kong’s 49 registered foreign law firms came from mainland China. By 2017 about 30% of 84 such firms had their headquarters in Beijing or Shanghai, according to a study by Mr Liu and Anson Au, also of the University of Toronto.

Chinese practices are finding it easier to recruit local lawyers versed in common law, thanks in part to institutions such as Peking University’s School of Transnational Law in Shenzhen, which offers degrees in both American and Chinese law. In recent years many more graduates have joined Chinese firms rather than American ones, which they overwhelmingly favoured in the past, observes its dean, Philip McConnaughay. Growing size and an ability to compete with global rivals on pay has “clearly lifted the prestige” of Chinese firms in a relatively short period, he says.

China is not content mastering the niceties of the old order. It is also subtly forging a new one around Chinese law. This begins by luring international students to its law schools, mostly from poor countries along the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ), its globe-spanning programme of infrastructure works. Plenty receive plush bursaries from the government in Beijing. Since only Chinese citizens can practise law in China, many foreign graduates prefer to return home, as paid-up members of China-friendly legal networks.

Some of these networks are formal. The All-China Lawyers Association, equivalent to Western bar associations, established an international group in 2019 to promote legal co-operation and is active in at least 36 countries. Chinese-owned firms like Grandall are setting up BRI practices. King & Wood Mallesons, created by the merger between a Chinese firm called King & Wood and Mallesons, an Australian one, has launched a think-tank-like affiliate to connect Chinese lawyers with local firms, companies and governments across Africa and Asia.

But it is informal webs that are more numerous, and possibly more powerful. Chinese companies seeking to enter new markets hire Chinese firms, which then enlist friendly local lawyers. The locals conduct due diligence, manage compliance with domestic law and appear in court on behalf of Chinese corporate clients, says Matthew Erie of Oxford University, who has studied such arrangements. The Chinese law firms oversee cross-border transactions and dispute resolution. Fees are split accordingly.

Sustained

These networks attract less attention than new Red Circle digs in Manhattan or tie-ups with white-shoe firms, says Mr Erie. In time, they may nevertheless be as successful at spreading Chinese influence as Anglo-Saxon law firms were in perpetuating that of the West. ■","['red', 'university', 'american', 'western', 'firms', 'lawyers', 'local', 'law', 'honour', 'expansion', 'companies', 'chinese', 'world']",2021-03-03 00:00:00
5,['The Economist'],"OVER THE past decade, avalanches have killed an average of 27 people in America every year. It took only until February 17th, halfway through the winter-sports season, to reach that number this year, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Centre, a state agency. So far 33 skiers, snowboarders and other adventurers have been killed by avalanches, mostly in the mountainous western states. In one particularly deadly week in early February there were more avalanche fatalities than any other week in the last 100 years. On current trends, there could be as many as 51 deaths this season, surpassing the previous record of 36 (see chart).

In a sense, an avalanche is a simple phenomenon—little more than snow sliding down an incline. Yet numerous things can cause the various layers of snow that gather on mountains, collectively called a snowpack, to come tumbling down. Wind strength and direction, which way a slope faces and the level of vegetation all play a role. Avalanches can also be triggered by earthquakes or slightly warmer weather that causes a layer of snow to lose its grip on the layer below. People are also frequently to blame. Although avalanches triggered by backcountry adventurers tend to release less snow than those triggered by other causes, they are often deadlier.

This year many snowpacks have been dangerously unstable. A period of prolonged dry weather weakened the base laid down by the winter’s first snowstorms. Then in late January and early February, heavy blizzards dumped masses of fresh snow on top. What’s more, some suspect that more people have taken to the backcountry this year looking to divert themselves during the pandemic. Although it is too early to know for sure whether this has led to more deaths on the slopes, the number of human-caused avalanches has been higher this year than in the past.

Avalanche fatalities have been creeping up for years. (In the 1950s the annual average was only four). Climate change may be partly to blame: over the past few decades less snow at lower elevations has led to a decrease in the size and run-out distance of avalanches, but an increase in avalanche activity involving wet snow higher up. Still, the main culprit is probably the growing popularity of backcountry skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. As people migrate from manicured ski slopes to the wilds, the risk of avalanches naturally increases. Thanks to improvements in equipment, intrepid skiers have been able to stray ever farther off piste. The Colorado Avalanche Information Centre has said that incidents are becoming less probable, but more dangerous. It might be best to stay off the slopes for now.","['skiers', 'week', 'snow', 'slopes', 'chart', 'deadly', 'backcountry', 'avalanche', 'early', 'america', 'avalanches', 'triggered', 'daily', 'particularly', 'weather']",2021-03-03 00:00:00
6,['The Economist'],"T HE LIST of great prime ministers Britain never had includes Joseph Chamberlain, Rab Butler and Michael Heseltine. It does not include Ed Miliband. He flunked the big test that the British traditionally impose on anyone who aspires to the highest office in the land—retaining your dignity while eating a bacon sandwich. The one election campaign he fought as leader, in 2015, was a double disaster for his party: David Cameron won with a solid majority and a dejected Labour Party turned to Jeremy Corbyn for solace. Yet when it comes to public policy Mr Miliband continues to exercise considerable influence. We live in the age of Miliband more than we live in the age of Cameron or Corbyn.

In the budget on March 3rd Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, stole three of Mr Miliband’s ideas: gradually raising the corporation tax rate from 19% of profits to 25%, opening a national infrastructure bank in the provinces and encouraging corporate investment using tax incentives. This is not the first time Mr Sunak has followed Mr Miliband’s advice. He has already rewritten Treasury rules on the grounds that their narrow definition of costs and benefits favours investment in London.

The chancellor is only the latest in a succession of Tory smash-and-grab artists. Theresa May capped energy prices, clamped down on high-interest loans, tightened labour regulations and even flirted with the idea of putting workers on boards. Boris Johnson raised taxes on and restricted advertising of unhealthy food and drink, and renationalised Northern Rail; all policies that, as a right-wing newspaper columnist, he would have derided.

There is nothing unusual about politicians lifting ideas from other parties. Benjamin Disraeli’s winning formula was to find where the liberals were bathing and steal their clothes. He defined the ideal government as “Tory men and Whig measures”. Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan repeated the trick by consolidating Labour’s welfare state; Tony Blair and Gordon Brown did the same with Margaret Thatcher’s free-market reforms. It is not the stealing that is interesting, but the choice of ideas and the dexterity with which the trick is performed.

The theft of Mr Miliband’s ideas is evidence of a leftward turn in British politics. Tory newspapers vilified Mr Miliband as “Red Ed” who wanted to turn Britain into the sort of left-wing utopia his Marxist father favoured. The Economist advised voting against him on the ground that he was too much of a risk. Mr Cameron saw his enthusiasm for capping energy prices as proof that he was living in a “Marxist universe”. Today Red Ed’s Marxist deviations have magically transformed into Boris’s common sense.

Mr Corbyn likes to take credit for this by insisting that he won the battle of ideas even if he lost the general election. But almost without exception the ideas that have survived from that era were generated by Mr Miliband and his leadership team. Mr Miliband is a policy wonk who, in the wake of the financial crisis, came to the conclusion that Labour needed to be bold. He surrounded himself with other wonks, notably Stewart Wood (who now sits in the House of Lords) and Torsten Bell (who now runs the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank). Their ideas initially found little purchase because the Conservatives did such a good job of blaming the financial crisis on Labour’s management of the public finances. A combination of austerity fatigue and covid-19 has created an appetite for state activism.

The great theft is also proof of something that is less comforting to the soft left: the Tories are the world’s most accomplished political thieves. They have not only merrily stolen economic policies from a man they dubbed a deranged Marxist but also stolen nationalist ideas from a man they vilified as a “swivel-eyed loon”, Nigel Farage. They have killed off his UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) by embracing a Brexit that leaves Britain outside the customs union and the internal market; something Mr Farage once regarded as too extreme. And they have kept ex- UKIP voters happy by giving prominent positions to hardliners such as Priti Patel, the home secretary, and Suella Braverman, the attorney-general.

Stealing ideas from both the left and the right has allowed the Tories to adjust to a new world in which the liberal verities that were at the heart of Mr Cameron’s premiership have lost their popularity. It has also allowed them to change their political coalition, losing some voters from the professional classes, but more than making up for their loss by increasing their support among the working classes, particularly in the north.

The biggest worry for the Tories is whether they have drifted too far in each direction. They are confronted with potential quarrels between the party’s core voters in the prosperous south and its new recruits in the north: will stockbrokers really pay higher taxes to improve rail transport to Grimsby? They are also plagued by contradictions between, say, spending more money on infrastructure and balancing the books, which Mr Sunak suggests he regards as a sacred Tory duty. The trouble with a melange of ideas—something old, something new, something borrowed, something red—is that they pull in opposite directions.

Appropriate appropriating

But you can have worse problems in a country that is recovering from a pandemic and heading towards a period of growth. Mr Johnson does not seem to worry much about logical contradictions: he would happily build a blue-red-green coalition so long as it kept him in power. And Mr Sunak is less concerned than he pretends to be: though he hints that he would love to return to the Conservative low-tax, small-state orthodoxy, he is happy to cast aside ideology for the time being. The party that really suffers from the Tories’ theft is Labour. It’s hard to decry everything a government does when it is implementing your ideas. The brilliance of the trick the Tories have pulled off is that it leaves Labour with nowhere to go. ■","['voters', 'tories', 'ideas', 'tory', 'miliband', 'party', 'worldbeaters', 'mr', 'comes', 'bagehot', 'marxist', 'labour', 'sunak', 'stealing']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
7,['The Economist'],"E VERY TIME one of America’s genetic-testing companies advertises a deal on DNA kits, Michael (not his real name) braces himself for what may follow: a message from one of his hitherto unknown offspring. Three decades ago, as a student at the University of Houston, Michael became a sperm donor; the clinic would “pull me out of retirement”, he says, every time a customer wanted to expand their family. So far, the 55-year-old knows of around 60 children (and a dozen grandchildren) he has sired in addition to the four teenagers he shares with his wife; he suspects the true number is closer to 100.

“I could write a book,” he says, about the lifelong consequences of what had seemed, at the time, like an easy buck and an incentive to live healthily (he steered clear of heavy drinking and drugs to preserve his sperm's motility). Several children contact him regularly. He has been surprised by how many had been led to believe the father who brought them up was their biological parent: “Sometimes they’re very angry they’ve been lied to all their lives”. He is aware of some offspring who know his identity but have not made contact, and of a Facebook group he is not part of “so they can compare notes”. He gets a lot of cards on Father’s Day.

An ever-increasing number of men (and women who donate eggs) will have similar experiences. Because America’s sperm- and egg-donor industry is largely unregulated, no one knows how many children have been conceived this way. But social changes mean the industry is going through a period of extraordinary and unprecedented growth. Most of the children Michael fathered were born within heterosexual marriages. Today such couples constitute a minority of clinics’ customers, in part because advances in reproductive medicine mean more couples with fertility problems are able to conceive. But there are two bigger reasons for the change: the legalisation of gay marriage and the rising number of single women who are choosing to become mothers. The majority of sperm banks’ customers today are gay couples and women without partners.

Rosanna Hertz of Wellesley College, the author of “Random Families”, says the market is booming as gay Americans reach marrying age and elective single motherhood becomes more widespread. Partly because conceiving using donor sperm is a lot more straightforward and affordable than doing so using donor eggs, children born through sperm donors are likely to outnumber those from egg donors.

Surging demand and an absence of government regulation have created a field that has developed “more like a business than medicine”, says Dov Fox of the University of San Diego, the author of “Birth Rights and Wrongs”. The line is often blurred. Regulating baby-making can raise difficult ethical questions about who should be parents and who should be born. But some elementary regulations are overdue, not least because clinics are already making such decisions: requiring, for example, that sperm donors should be a certain height and educated to college level.

Gametes gate

The most obvious gap is a legal limit on the number of children a sperm-clinic donor, however tall and brilliant he may be, can help create. America is one of the few countries to have no such cap (Britain, by comparison, has a limit of ten donor-created families per donor). Many clinics have their own limits. Jaime Shamonki of Generate Life Sciences, which operates California Cryobank, America’s biggest sperm bank, says although people worry that large groups of half-siblings could lead to incest, a bigger concern is that a donor with an undiagnosed hereditary health condition may spread it widely.

But without a law, even self-imposed limits are routinely flouted. Alan (not his real name) reckons he fathered “hundreds” of children as a result of the four years he donated sperm to a clinic three times a week. Because he had a high sperm count, most of his donations were divided into 15 to 20 vials (one is used per insemination effort) and they tended to sell out. The clinic, he says, never mentioned a limit on the number of children he would beget, though he is not complaining; in his most lucrative year he made $50,000.

Beside health concerns, there is another important reason for limiting a donor’s fecundity. The children of sperm and egg donors, like those who are adopted, often want to trace their blood relations. But it is difficult to forge strong relationships when vast numbers of children are involved. Wendy Kramer of the Donor Sibling Registry, which helps connect members of donor families, says this is an example of how the contract between clinics and would-be parents has ignored the interests of the children it produces. She established the group in 2000 after her then ten-year-old son, conceived using donor sperm, had become curious about his wider family. Last month he learned of the existence of two new half-siblings, bringing the tally to 22. Ms Kramer had been told her sperm donor would father no more than ten children, a limit she considers sensible.

Related to this is the issue of anonymity. Most sperm clinics in America offer donors the option of remaining anonymous until a child is 18, or for ever. But because donor-conceived children, like adopted ones, fare better psychologically when told of their origins from babyhood and allowed to trace their relatives if they wish to, there is a push to prohibit anonymity. It is, in any case, a false promise, thanks to DNA testing. There would be a cost: when anonymity is banned the number of donors falls. Other countries have decided that is a price worth paying for children’s well-being. Anonymity (and the fact that donors can be paid) is one of the reasons America has become an exporter of sperm.","['fertility', 'children', 'number', 'limit', 'sperm', 'swimming', 'extends', 'americas', 'donors', 'anonymity', 'markets', 'women', 'donor', 'clinics', 'using', 'freestyle', 'free', 'love']",2021-03-03 00:00:00
8,['The Economist'],"This article has been updated since its publication.

WHEN THE first covid-19 vaccines began to be distributed in December, Jürgen Stock, the secretary-general of Interpol, the world’s policing body, called them “the liquid gold of 2021, the most precious thing to distribute”. When something is precious, and in short supply, sharp practice, corruption and crime may not be far away.

At least 11 covid-19 vaccines have so far been approved for use in at least one country, and more are in the pipeline. The makers of these jabs claim they can, theoretically, produce about 12.2bn shots by the end of 2021, more than enough to give two doses to each of the 5.8bn adults in the world. But production delays are already slowing things down, and the vaccines made will not be distributed evenly. At least 40% of all vaccine orders come from rich countries with just 18% of the world’s population. Within those countries, some groups are being given priority access to vaccines: the elderly, key workers, and people with certain health conditions. Everyone else—individuals and countries alike—is being told they will simply have to wait. Many are not willing to.

The underhand ways in which people are trying to get their hands on covid-19 vaccines can, roughly, be divided into three categories. The first consists of legal but ethically dubious actions, in which people with means try to exploit loopholes in countries where vaccines are already available. In America, for example, states have been allowed to determine their own roll-out strategies, leading to discrepancies between them. “The states are all over the place,” says Arthur Caplan, a professor of medical ethics at the Grossman School of Medicine at New York University. “[Florida] basically said, ‘Get in line and we’ll vaccinate almost anybody.’” Florida at first announced it would give a shot to anyone aged 65 or over who turned up. The state has since tightened the rules, requiring ID to prove state residence, to crack down on people travelling there to get vaccinated. But Florida has so far given more than 80,000 doses, out of a total of more than 3m, to people living elsewhere, according to official state figures. Meanwhile, Mr Caplan has heard of some luxury “concierge” medical practices, which charge patients hefty annual fees in return for the best in round-the-clock care, that are getting hold of vaccines for their clients.

“Vaccine tourism”, as seen in Florida, is also taking off on an international level. In January the British press reported that Knightsbridge Circle—a luxury lifestyle club—had been flying members to the United Arab Emirates to receive shots of the vaccine developed by Sinopharm, a Chinese company, which is not currently approved in Britain. The UAE does not seem averse to using vaccines to market itself more widely, either. A government campaign to get “digital nomads” (remote workers) to move to Dubai stresses that all residents are eligible for a jab. Cuba is also prepared to use the lure of vaccination. The country, whose economy is heavily reliant on tourism, has said that holidaymakers will be offered its homegrown Soberana 02 vaccine once it is approved (it is still undergoing trials).

The second category of vaccine shenanigans is through political favours and preferential access. In January the Philippines’ Senate began an enquiry into why, before any covid-19 vaccine was even authorised in the country, bodyguards of Rodrigo Duterte, the president, were inoculated with jabs smuggled in from China. (Senior members of the cabinet were also rumoured to have received shots.) Evidence of queue-jumping has cropped up in many places. On February 23rd the World Bank threatened to pull its funding for Lebanon’s vaccination programme after 16 lawmakers were vaccinated inside the parliament building, possibly violating the World Bank’s stipulation that, to curb corruption, Lebanese citizens should register for their jabs online. Argentina’s health minister resigned after reports that influential people in the country were able to get shots without following proper procedure. Peru’s health and foreign ministers also quit over accusations that hundreds of officials had been vaccinated before a national immunisation programme began. In other countries, including America, politicians have been classed as essential workers and vaccinated early without fuss.

Third comes the black market, which has flourished at every stage of the pandemic. In March 2020, amid shortages of personal protective equipment, authorities in Thailand busted an operation reselling used face masks. Remdesivir, a drug used in the treatment of covid-19 and in short supply, was available in India and Venezuela at many times its retail price. In China, buyers snapped up similar drugs used to treat a different coronavirus in cats. In Pakistan, doctors witnessed a flourishing trade in the blood plasma of recovered patients, which was touted as a rapid route to immunity.

As for vaccines, on December 2nd—the day that Britain became the first country to authorise a fully tested covid-19 vaccine for emergency use—Interpol told governments to brace themselves for a wave of crime “in relation to the falsification, theft and illegal advertising” of jabs. So far, just a few instances have been reported. In January, Ukrainian police launched an investigation into people paying €3,000 ($3,600) a pop to receive unauthorised jabs, which they speculated had been brought in from Israel. In February, Italian authorities began investigating offers made to officials in the Veneto region from “unnamed intermediaries” to sell them 27m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine outside of the country’s procurement scheme. And this week police in eastern China arrested more than 80 people after seizing thousands of doses of fake vaccines destined for export. Hundreds of similar vials were also found in South Africa. Interpol said the seizures were just ""the tip of the iceberg"" of crime related to covid-19.

Black-market vaccines can be dangerous. They can be stored and administered incorrectly, or might be outright fakes. Vaccine queue-jumping has less obvious ill-effects, though it rankles when the well-connected or well-heeled barge to the front, and those shoved aside may suffer. And so long as life-saving vaccines are in short supply in one or other part of the world, the unscrupulous and the desperate will try schemes, stunts and swindles that promise a short-cut to immunity.","['ways', 'vaccinated', 'shots', 'countries', 'spread', 'florida', 'covid19', 'underhand', 'vaccines', 'vaccine', 'world', 'jabs', 'country', 'queuejumping']",2021-03-03 00:00:00
9,['The Economist'],"O N MARCH 5TH 2020 Mumbai’s horseracing season culminated with the Poonawalla Breeders’ Multimillion, a day-long extravaganza dominated by India’s first family of the sport, the Poonawallas. Triumphs at the track were accompanied by news reports on the Bollywood lifestyles of Adar Poonawalla and his wife, Natasha, whom Elle magazine described as “India’s first lady of fabulousness”. Only cursory attention spilled over to the couple’s day job running Serum Institute of India, the press-shy vaccine-maker at the root of the family fortune.

A year on it is the company, not its flamboyant owners, that is making headlines. As the covid-19 vaccination drive encounters production glitches in Europe, hits distribution snags in America and faces a geopolitical scramble for supply everywhere, Serum Institute has emerged as the one firm apparently able to ramp up production fast and export the doses without courting controversy. By the end of the year, Mr Poonawalla says, it will add 1.5bn covid-19 shots to 1.3bn-1.5bn doses against diseases from measles to tuberculosis that it already produces annually. On February 23rd it dispatched the first mass shipment, of 70m shots of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, to India and two dozen other poor countries in the COVAX vaccine-sharing programme. On March 1st Canada said it will procure 500,000 doses from the company. The relatively small family concern, which entered last year with annual revenues of $735m and a workforce of 6,000, is becoming mission-critical to the global fight against the coronavirus.

Mr Poonawalla’s plans are ambitious, to put it mildly. He wants to raise monthly production of the Oxford vaccine from the current 60m-70m to 100m by April. That month the company will start churning out 40m-50m of a shot developed by Novavax, an American biotechnology firm, to build up a “large stock” as it undergoes accelerated review by a number of global regulators. By late summer Serum Institute expects to be making another vaccine, by SpyBiotech, a British startup. In early 2022 it hopes to be producing a one-dose nasal vaccine being developed by Codagenix, another American biotech firm.

Mr Poonawalla estimates that until rivals’ new capacity comes online in the autumn, his company’s output will account for perhaps 40-50% of the world’s supply. Unlike Pfizer, an American drug giant which recently upped its production goal from 1.3bn to 2bn doses this year, Serum Institute’s shots are cheap and do not need to be stored at ultra-low temperatures. They will inoculate swathes of the poor world.

Some of the factors behind the company’s rise to prominence, like the pandemic and scientists’ rapid response to it, have been beyond its control. But Serum Institute has also placed bold bets that run counter to the traditional process of making vaccines, in which investments in capacity and distribution follow years of research, then more years of clinical trials for safety and efficacy. A brief conversation last April, between Mr Poonawalla and his father Cyrus, Serum Institute’s founder, resulted in a decision to start producing the Oxford vaccine before any clinical trials had begun.

It is the latest daring coup by the Poonawallas. In the 1960s Cyrus turned his horse-breeding business into one that used retired steeds as living vessels to create antibody serum for treatment of snake bites, tetanus and other scourges. Forty years later his son, who has been chief executive since 2011, has added 165 countries as customers (often while courting Natasha on holidays). International sales now account for 70% of the firm’s total. In December Serum Institute released the first vaccine to be fully developed in India, against a variant of pneumonia which kills 68,000 Indian children a year.

The company’s initial investment of $80m in capacity to produce the untested Oxford shot came from its billionaire owners’ own pocket—a tidy sum next to the previous year’s $46m in capital expenditure. Since then Serum Institute has received a further $800m: $270m from the Poonawallas, $300m from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the world’s biggest charity, and the rest from prepayments by governments, including those of Bangladesh and Morocco.

The privately held firm will not say how much of that money has already been deployed. But Mr Poonawalla says it has doubled production capacity. It could do this quickly, he adds, thanks to a strategy of installing “excess capacity ahead of demand”. For decades it had been adding a new building each year; one that was ready to go shortly before the fateful chat between father and son was immediately repurposed for the covid-19 effort.

A long-standing collaboration with Oxford and Novavax as part of an effort to create a malaria vaccine allowed Serum Institute to secure their recipes early. Deep relationships with suppliers of everything from glass vials to expensive “bioreactors” for the production of biological substances have helped smooth procurement. Serum Institute has hired 1,000 new employees, increasing its workforce by a sixth. Another 500 construction workers are putting up new buildings with higher production capacity to add to the 30 or so that the company has erected over the years.

At the current pace, Mr Poonawalla thinks, it will take at least two years for the global supply of covid-19 jabs to meet demand. It could take less if the world’s regulators co-ordinated more closely for the duration of the crisis, he ventures. Until then Serum Institute expects to be selling the jabs more or less at cost, which means about $3-5 a dose for the Oxford vaccine. After that, margins will eventually rise. “This situation will last for a long time and there will be future demand,” Mr Poonawalla predicts. Covid-19 looks certain to become endemic in many parts of the world, with annual vaccination drives akin to those for influenza becoming the norm. His firm’s output will peak at 600m-700m doses a year for each of the four vaccines it is currently eyeing, he says.

The pandemic will leave vaccine-making more prominent than ever before, Mr Poonawalla believes—and much more crowded. This will inject competition into what most drugmakers consider a thankless volume business with considerable capital outlays. A fire earlier this year at one new building sent a shudder down the spines of the world’s covid-responders until the company assured them that the accident, which affected a production line for a tuberculosis jab, will not hurt the pandemic effort. Although the bet on the Oxford vaccine has paid off, and the one on Novavax looks likely to, Codagenix and SpyBiotech are not yet shoo-ins. And vaccine nationalism could stymie exports from India or imports of ingredients and kit.

Mr Poonawalla nevertheless remains confident that his firm will maintain its leading position. In contrast to big pharma, which spends billions on marketing costly medicines, it sells its vaccines chiefly to national health authorities, which prize low prices and reliable supply above all. Those have always been Serum Institute’s strong suits. And the Indian company’s remarkable response to covid-19 has bought it more global goodwill than any advertising campaign could hope to. ■","['shots', 'institute', 'ahead', 'capacity', 'oxford', 'mr', 'covid19', '2021', 'production', 'vaccine', 'poonawalla', 'billionplus', 'serum', 'racing', 'doses']",2021-03-03 00:00:00
10,['The Economist'],"AFTER INITIALLY emphasising that the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, first found in south-east England, was more contagious but not any more deadly than the wild-type virus, Boris Johnson said on January 22nd that it seemed associated with higher mortality after all. That is surprising. Viruses tend to become less lethal over time. Why might this virus not be following the rules?

For organisms to replicate, genetic material must be copied. Occasionally, errors creep in and are passed on. Such mutations occur in animals, plants, fungi, bacteria—and viruses. They are almost always fatal, so offspring with them die before they can reproduce. Very rarely, the error grants an advantage that helps the offspring reproduce more successfully than their unmutated kin.

Viruses depend upon people spreading them and many, like HIV, Ebola and the original SARS, usually make a person particularly infectious only after they have spread throughout the body. At that point the host’s cells are under extensive attack, the immune system is working hard and the carrier feels exhausted and terrible. From an evolutionary perspective, the virus benefits if this period of extreme infectiousness is drawn out for as long as possible, in order to give its progeny more time to spread. Killing the host abruptly limits the chances for a virus to infect others, even if the virus can spread from a corpse. That is why mutations which make a virus less lethal are often favoured by natural selection.

However, with SARS-CoV-2 that is not a factor because the virus makes people most infectious around the time they first show symptoms and weeks before they are likely to perish from complications. If a person dies a few weeks after having been highly infectious, it has almost no effect on the evolutionary trajectory of the virus. Thus, it is just as likely for chance mutations to crop up in the viral genetic code that make it more lethal as it is for chance mutations to make it less lethal.

B.1.1.7 and some other variants, including the one recently identified in California, have spread widely because they have mutations that modify the tool the virus uses to invade cells. SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike or “S” protein to attach itself to receptors on cell surfaces that, once activated, let the virus inject its genetic material. Though the mechanism remains obscure, changes in the spike protein help B.1.1.7 and the other variants enter cells. One effect is that they are more infectious.

How B.1.1.7 ended up with both a mutation that enhances its lethality and a mutation that makes it more infectious is also a mystery. Perhaps two separate genetic changes happened independently in a single infected individual, but the odds of that are low. Since these two mutations were not found in individual viral strains before B.1.1.7. variant was detected, it is also unlikely that two variants of the virus, each carrying one of the two mutations, merged their genetic information in a single unlucky person infected by both at the same time. More likely is a web of molecular interactions that meant the appearance of one mutation triggered the appearance of another, like dominos knocking one another down. Virologists increasingly think that just a small number of genetic alterations are driving substantial changes in the behaviour of the virus.

The new variants are all more inclined to mutate than the wild-type virus that was spotted in Wuhan in 2019. Coronaviruses have large genomes and their extra genetic material looks as if it is used to “error check” the viral copies that are made inside a host cell. Error-checking probably helped the virus endure in bat populations for centuries where it faced precious little resistance. Now that it is facing extreme resistance having moved to a new species—humans—that has imposed lockdowns, masks and vaccines, the error-checking components in the viral genome are less valuable. Instead, it is the very ability to mutate that is being selected for. More domino-like cascades of mutations may be in store.

11,['The Economist'],"THE SECOND wave of the pandemic has been devastating in much of the world. Since September 1st covid-19 has claimed the lives of 1.6m people, compared with 850,000 in the preceding nine months. In America alone, the death toll passed 500,000 on February 22nd. What is more, new variants that may be more transmissible, more deadly or better at evading the body’s immune response are spreading.

At last, some optimism is budding. More than 200m doses of covid-19 vaccine have been administered across 92 countries. After a slow start, America’s programme is gathering speed: 16% of adults have received a first shot, and President Joe Biden is on target to meet his goal of 150m doses by his 100th day in office. The number of infections in the country is falling by half every 14 days.

In Israel, where vaccination has got off to the fastest start, evidence of falling deaths and hospitalisation rates appeared a couple of weeks ago. Britain is the first big country to show similar results. This has emboldened Boris Johnson, the prime minister, to announce a cautious and phased easing of restrictions in England on February 22nd. It will begin with the reopening of schools on March 8th (Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales set their own timetables).

Two months have passed since Britain became the first country in the world to start a mass-vaccination programme on December 8th. In that time 31% of adults have received at least one dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines. By January 24th 80% of England’s 2.8m over-80s—those at the front of the national queue—had received their first dose. They were followed by the country’s 4.7m septuagenarians: by February 7th 83% of this group had been inoculated.

There is growing evidence that these vaccines work outside clinical trials. A study from Scotland released on February 22nd tracked the health of 1.1m people vaccinated between December 8th and February 15th. It found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reduced the hospitalisation rate among inoculated Scots by 85% four weeks after their first dose; the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine lowered hospitalisations by 94%. (The variation between the effectiveness of the vaccines may be down to age differences among the recipients rather than the vaccines themselves.)

Publicly available data from England show a similar trend. The daily death toll from covid-19 peaked on January 22nd at 1,164 (on a seven-day moving average). It has since fallen by 64%. The decline has been greatest among the old. Deaths have fallen by 66% among people aged 85 and over, by 62% among those between aged 65 to 84 and by 60% among the rest of the population (see chart). This does not appear to be a statistical fluke: a similar demographic dividend is observable in the decline in hospital admissions (though not in cases), and in regional data. These findings are bolstered by the Scottish study, too—the effect of lower hospitalisations among vaccinated groups should be observable in the aggregate data. The effect, although still small, will help Mr Johnson to stick to his timetable for easing: in England people aged 80 and over account for 6% of cases but 60% of deaths.

Britain’s experience, with the evidence from Israel, offers hope to other countries, not least because it suggests the vaccines are effective against the more transmissible (and possibly more deadly) variant of SARS-CoV-2, known as B.1.1.7, which has been dominant since Christmas. Although Mr Johnson has made many mistakes, the roll-out of vaccines has been a success. If all goes to plan England’s last restrictions will be removed on June 21st. Logistical problems and political infighting have led to slow roll-outs in many other countries, including members of the EU. The evidence from Britain shows that once jabs are in arms, the simple beauty of science alone will write the headlines.","['22nd', 'start', 'received', 'chart', 'covid19', 'daily', 'johnson', 'effective', 'vaccines', 'vaccine', 'similar', 'england', 'evidence', 'shows', 'britain', 'dose']",2021-02-22 00:00:00

13,['The Economist'],"F OR MANY members of China’s 3m-strong domestic-security forces, these must be worrying times. On February 27th the Communist Party declared the start of a long-expected purge of their ranks. It will involve, say officials, “turning the knife-blade inward” to gouge out those deemed corrupt or insufficiently loyal to the party and its leader, Xi Jinping. More than eight years into Mr Xi’s iron rule, the party appears to wonder whether a vital bulwark of its power is entirely trustworthy.

State-controlled media have described it as the biggest such campaign since the late 1990s within the domestic-security system, which includes the police, the secret police, the judiciary and prisons. It is due to last for about a year. The aim is to ensure that these agencies are “absolutely loyal, absolutely pure and absolutely reliable”. Officials say the campaign will be like the “Yan’an Rectification” of the early 1940s. That was when Mao—then the leader of a communist insurgency—staged a sweeping and brutal purge of the party’s ranks to consolidate his control. Such language suggests that many heads will roll as the party attempts to clear the “dense miasma” surrounding the security apparatus, cure it of “chronic illness” and ensure it remains “surnamed Party” (meaning as loyal to the party as if to a family member).

It is remarkable that such a campaign is deemed necessary. After he took over as China’s leader in 2012 Mr Xi launched the country’s toughest battle against corruption in decades. Hundreds of thousands of officials were punished, including powerful people with security backgrounds. One of them was Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee. Before Mr Xi assumed power, Mr Zhou had overseen the entire law-enforcement apparatus. In 2015 he was sentenced to life in prison—ostensibly for graft and leaking state secrets. Officials later alleged—without giving details—that he had engaged in “political plotting”, too. It is widely believed that he was an opponent of Mr Xi. But on February 3rd party investigators said the police had failed to eliminate Mr Zhou’s “pernicious influence” within the force and had not followed the party line “satisfactorily enough”.

Several high-ranking security officials have been snared by the party’s anti-corruption agency in the past few months. The most prominent is Gong Daoan, then Shanghai’s police chief and one of the city’s deputy mayors. Last August he became the third policeman with a rank equivalent to that of a vice-minister to be placed under investigation since the start of 2020. The following month Mr Gong was stripped of his posts. On March 1st the government announced that he had been arrested and his case referred to prosecutors.

The charges against Mr Gong include abuse of his positions to promote his and others’ business interests, corruption related to the approval of appointments, misuse of his official car and frequent attendance of banquets that raised questions about his impartiality. But Mr Gong’s alleged political offences are listed first: forming factions within the party and “completely lacking the four awarenesses”, ie, of the need for loyalty to the party and to Mr Xi, and for compliance with their orders and total adherence to the party’s line. Such accusations will probably be levelled at more police chiefs during the upcoming purge. The loyalty of the security agencies “directly affects the party’s position at the helm of state and the continuance of political stability”, said an official report on a meeting of party bosses that kicked off the nationwide campaign.

Its launch was heralded in July with trial runs in a handful of local police forces, courts and prosecutors’ offices, as well as in two prisons and one local state-security bureau (home to the dissident- and spy-hunting secret police). In charge of this experimental phase was Chen Yixin, a senior security official who appears to be a troubleshooter for Mr Xi—in February last year, in the early days of the covid-19 pandemic, he was sent to Wuhan to help supervise efforts to crush and contain the central city’s massive outbreak of the disease. Mr Chen said “education and rectification” of the security forces was a task of “urgency and extreme importance”. He described the campaign as “scraping the bones to remove the poison, and draining away the filth to bring in fresh water”. Police at the time were reaching the end of a three-year campaign against criminal gangs and their “protective umbrellas” within the government. That effort resulted in the smashing of more than 14,700 criminal groups. But apparently it did not succeed in purifying the police.

Assuming the campaign will follow the pattern of last year’s experiments, participants can expect to spend a month studying the kind of behaviour that is expected of them. They will then perform “self-examination” and be required to admit to any wrongdoing. These confessions will be compared with other submissions, including complaints from members of the public. High-level teams will be dispatched from Beijing to ensure the job is done properly. Among the 16,000 people who were involved in the trial phase, more than 2,200 were disciplined, including 39 who were formally charged. If punishments are meted out at the same rate nationally, then the “overall reckoning”, as one newspaper described the purge, may result in thousands being jailed and hundreds of thousands punished in other ways.

The campaign may benefit Mr Xi. Late next year he will preside over a five-yearly party congress, which will mark a critical juncture of his leadership. Normally he would be expected to step down at this event, having served as general secretary for a decade. But he shows no intention of doing so. There have been few obvious signs of opposition to granting him another five-year term. The contrast between China’s successful control of the coronavirus and the West’s fumbling response may have further strengthened his hand. But by tightening his grip on the security forces he can be even more certain that no one will dare to oppose him. ■","['chinas', 'bones', 'scraping', 'agencies', 'security', 'officials', 'xi', 'undergoing', 'mr', 'party', 'forces', 'partys', 'campaign', 'purge', 'domesticsecurity', 'massive', 'thousands']",2021-03-01 00:00:00
14,['The Economist'],"I N THE HILLY village of Iitate, in Fukushima prefecture, stands a new community centre built with parts pulled from abandoned buildings. Windows from one, doors from another. A chalkboard from a beloved school with no children to attend it. One cloudy day last autumn, a crowd gathered to celebrate its opening. As an elderly woman in a green kimono sang folk tunes, her voice riding a beat or two behind the music, the audience, a mix of locals and Tokyo-ites involved in the centre’s design, feasted on chestnut-filled rice balls.

Iitate is a farming district once known for its fine beef and dried radish. In 2010 it qualified for membership of a club called “Most beautiful villages of Japan”. Yet its recent history has been far from bucolic. Some 35km to the south-east, across the verdant Abukuma mountains, stands the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. Opened in 1971, it was one of dozens built around Japan to power the post-war economy. The government offered municipalities generous subsidies for hosting the plants, and promised people that they posed no risks. By 2011 Japan had 54 working reactors, providing a third of the country’s electricity.

At 2:46pm on March 11th of that year, an earthquake shook Japan’s north-eastern coast. The quake triggered a tsunami, sending waves as high as 40 metres crashing along 500km of coastline. Homes and roads were obliterated. Though the plant withstood the waves, its back-up generators were flooded, halting the essential flow of cooling water around its six reactors. Within days, three of them had melted down, spreading radiation across the region and panic around the world.

Thousands fled their homes. A few of them went first to Iitate, but the wind carried radioactive particles in its direction. Eventually the authorities ordered the evacuation of Iitate, too. Residents were allowed to return six years later, but only 1,500 have done so—a fraction of the 6,200 who called it home before the disaster. “The radiation effects are not visible, but I hope you can see how deeply it is felt,” says Tao Yoichi of Resurrection of Fukushima, the NGO that organised the construction of the community centre.

The earthquake literally reshaped the country: Japan’s biggest island moved 2.4 metres to the east. At the time, a similarly seismic shift in Japanese society was predicted. Politicians painted efforts to rehabilitate Fukushima as an emblem of a broader revival after a period of economic stagnation and demographic decline. Commentators spoke of 3/11, as the disaster came to be known, as a historical turning point, a shared experience that would shape a generation, a shock that would reinvigorate sclerotic institutions and open closed minds. Japan’s “post-war” period had given way to a new, “post-disaster” era, went one popular coinage. Kurokawa Kiyoshi, chairman of the parliamentary committee that investigated the disaster, spoke of 3/11 as a possible “third opening”, akin to the abolition of the shogunate in 1868 and Japan’s defeat in the second world war.

Ten years after 3/11, the third opening has yet to materialise. “I expected that Japan would finally start to change and I pinned hope on that prospect—but I’m afraid I was proven to be wrong,” says Funabashi Yoichi, chairman of an independent investigation into the accident. “The first instinct was just to restore, not to reform.” Mr Kurokawa agrees: “No, the crisis did not change Japan”.

It was, perhaps, too much to expect a revolution. The 3/11 disaster revealed internal failings, mostly of an intractable, structural sort, but also resilience. And though it battered Japan, it did not amount to complete defeat, as in the second world war. By chance, it occurred during only the second brief period in Japan’s post-war history when the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) was not in power. The association of the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ), in office from 2009 to 2012, with the disaster helped to discredit the idea of reform and political alternation. “Nuclear policy was implemented for many years by the LDP , but the DPJ had to take responsibility [for the disaster],” says Nakabayashi Mieko, a former MP with the DPJ . “Afterwards, people thought that while democracy in Japan was important, stability should have priority.”

“There’s been some change, but nothing at the pace commensurate with the promise,” argues Richard Samuels, author of “3.11: Disaster and Change in Japan”. A new regulator brought stricter oversight to the nuclear industry. But the LDP remains wedded to nuclear power despite public scepticism. Disaster preparedness has improved. But the same flaws that handicapped the response to the disaster—weak central authority, lack of co-ordination among ministries, poor communication, bureaucratic inflexibility—persist. And the political impetus for reform has dissipated, as the LDP has regained power, the DPJ has disintegrated and apathy has set in.

Miyagi and Iwate, the two other prefectures that suffered most from the earthquake and tsunami, have largely recovered. Fukushima itself has struggled. A small area is still uninhabitable. Kowata Masumi’s husband’s family had lived for more than 200 years in the same house in Okuma, one of the two towns next to the plant, growing persimmons, weaving silk and brewing sake. It is now in the “difficult-to-return” zone (see map), subject to 50 times more radiation than is typically considered safe. Former residents are allowed to make short visits in protective gear, but not to stay overnight. Ms Kowata, one of Okuma’s town councillors, found a monkey in her living room on one such trip, “wearing our clothes like the king of the house”.

For the most part, however, the problem is no longer contamination. Only 2.4% of the land area of the prefecture remains off-limits to residents. Only 36,811 people, or 2.1% of the population, are still unable to return home. Just one worker has died from direct radiation exposure. Cancer rates in the region have not spiked. Ambient radiation in most of the prefecture is comparable with other cities in Japan and around the world. The health risks are much less acute than what was feared in the disaster’s aftermath. In retrospect, it was the chaotic evacuation that probably harmed public health most. In Fukushima prefecture 2,317 people died as a result of it, mostly because of disruption to medical care or suicide. That is more than the 1,606 who perished during the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown themselves. Some researchers argue the government should not have ordered a large-scale evacuation at all, or should have limited it to weeks rather than years. Yet it would have been hard to tell a fearful population, faced with the invisible threat of radiation, to stay put or return quickly. The meltdown destroyed confidence in experts. The lack of candour from officials in the early weeks and months after the disaster sapped trust in the authorities, pushing citizens to fill the gaps themselves. “There were so many things that weren’t convincing, so we decided to get our own data,” says Kobayashi Tomoko, an inn-owner and radiation monitor from Minamisoma, a city north of the plant. Even when the government lifted evacuation orders years later, putting an end to compensation payments for residents of those areas, some protested against what they saw as a ploy to force people to return under unsafe conditions. “Sensitivity to radioactivity depends on mindset, it’s difficult to treat as matter of policy,” says Iio Jun of the Reconstruction Design Council, a government advisory panel set up after the disaster. “There are more emotional elements.” In the past decade the government’s efforts at reconstruction have focused on infrastructure and decontaminating land. Official presentations teem with graphics showing rebuilt roads and railways. Fully 96% of the planned public works have been completed. Millions of tonnes of waste from the disaster have been removed, including millions of cubic metres of radioactive topsoil. Recovery, by these measures, is progressing well. The Olympic Games (originally scheduled for 2020, but delayed until this summer owing to covid-19) are meant to be the culmination of the area’s rehabilitation. The government has promoted them as the “Recovery Olympics” and plans to begin the torch relay in Fukushima at a stadium that became a base for disaster relief in 2011. The flame will pass through Okuma, Iitate and Minamisoma on its way to Tokyo.

Yet the emphasis on physical reconstruction misses the point. “People’s hearts and spirits are not only not recovering, they’re being lost even more,” laments Sakurai Katsunobu, who was mayor of Minamisoma during 3/11. Rates of depression and anxiety among residents of Fukushima are more than double the national average. Diseases such as diabetes and hypertension have become more common, presumably because of continuing anxiety and disruption. Families have been separated, livelihoods lost. “Real recovery is not about making buildings, not about physical things,” says Ms Kowata.

“Who is this infrastructure actually being built for?” asks Mr Sakurai. Many of those ordered to evacuate in the aftermath of the disaster, as well as others who fled the region of their own accord, have stayed away. In the areas where evacuation was ordered, only a quarter or so of the population has returned, mostly the elderly. As elsewhere in rural Japan, the prefecture’s population had been falling anyway, dipping by an average of 100,000 people in the nine years preceding the disaster. But 3/11 has accelerated the decline: in the nine years since, the population has fallen by an average of 180,000 a year (see chart 1).

Rebuilding communities has proved far trickier than repaving roads. “Ten years is just the starting point,” says Mr Tao of Resurrection of Fukushima. “Only now are villages beginning to be able to think about the future.” Many have shifted from trying to get former residents to return towards attracting new arrivals. There have been successes. Near the community centre in Iitate, a group of young artists has converted a former school into studios. In Minamisoma, Wada Tomoyuki, an entrepreneur, runs a co-working space and small-business incubator where most of his partners are newcomers who wanted to escape office-bound city life. Yet progress is slow. Mr Wada launched Odaka Worker’s Base in 2014, hoping to assist 100 new businesses to help tackle local problems; so far, 15 have set up shop. The government touts a higher-tech future along the Fukushima “innovation coast”, a cluster of research and development centres. But most are engaged in projects connected to disaster relief or the nuclear plant’s decommissioning. The decommissioning itself “casts a heavy, dark shadow over the future”, says Uchibori Masao, Fukushima’s governor. The removal of 900 tonnes of melted fuel from the three reactors that failed—the most radioactive part of the wreckage—has yet to begin. TEPCO , the utility that owns the plant, thinks it will take 30-40 years, but even that may be optimistic. Last year, the Nuclear Regulation Authority ( NRA ), the new regulator set up after the accident, reported higher than expected levels of radiation on the temporary caps placed over two of the reactors. Such findings complicate plans for decommissioning. The fate of the decontaminated soil, which has been piled in black bags around the region, remains unresolved too. This year the bags are being taken to “interim storage facilities” in the “difficult to return” zone, meaning dumps in uninhabitable areas. By law, the soil must be sent outside the prefecture by 2045, but the government has yet to work out where to take it. The most pressing problem is the contaminated water that has seeped into the plant or has been used to cool spent fuel. There is already more than 1m tonnes of it, and storage space will run out next year. TEPCO filters it to remove all radioactive particles bar one isotope, tritium. The government wants to tip the filtered water into the ocean—standard practice at nuclear plants around the world. Yet fishermen and farmers fear this will make people loth to buy their wares. Activists worry that the tanks hold nasty surprises. After years of insisting the water contained only tritium, TEPCO revealed in 2018 that it would have to re-filter most of it, since it had not been treated properly and was more dangerous than had been admitted.

Such episodes have fed mistrust of the government’s assurances about public health in Fukushima. The screening of food from the prefecture is thorough and safety standards are high. The Fukushima Agricultural Technology Centre, a government body, tests 100-200 samples a day. Workers in rubber gloves chop up peaches, mushrooms and rice and feed them into devices that detect radiation. The last elevated result was six years ago. Independent monitors also judge local food to be safe. Yet products from Fukushima are still generally cheaper than those from elsewhere.

The enduring mistrust extends to nuclear power in general. Before 3/11 more than two-thirds of Japanese wanted to preserve or even expand it. The government wanted nuclear plants to generate half of Japan’s power by the middle of the century. A majority is now against it, including bigwigs such as Koizumi Junichiro, a former prime minister from the LDP , and Kan Naoto, who was prime minister at the time of the disaster. “I had supposed Japanese engineers were very high quality. I thought it was unlikely that human error could cause an accident in Japan,” says Mr Kan. “My thinking changed 180 degrees.”

The current government has not, however, given up on nuclear power. Abe Shinzo, prime minister from 2012 to 2020, was keen on it, but during this tenure, since most reactors were mothballed for stricter safety inspections, Japan grew notably more dependent on fossil fuels (see chart 2). To this day only nine of Japan’s 54 reactors have been allowed to restart. They provided just 6% of the country’s electricity last year. Nearly half of the rest are to be shut down; the others are in various forms of administrative limbo.

The current prime minister, Suga Yoshihide, has promised to make Japan carbon neutral by 2050. So he wants to build more wind farms and solar plants—but also to restart more of the idled nuclear reactors. “Zero carbon by 2050 means we need nuclear,” argues Toyoda Masakazu, who chairs the Institute of Energy Economics, a think-tank in Tokyo. Some towns are eager to go nuclear again. “After five or six years, people started thinking about how much risk we can bear in terms of economic growth,” says Nose Yutaka, mayor of Takahama, which recently became the first town to approve the restart of a nuclear plant that is more than 40 years old, the standard regulatory lifetime in Japan. The nuclear industry insists it has learned the lessons of 3/11. TEPCO says that the expectation of perfection, which stifled the reporting of problems, has been swept away. It and other power companies have poured billions of dollars into new seawalls, filter systems and other safety features. Local governments have drawn up proper evacuation plans. “Before Fukushima, it was assumed that if government officials are creating plans, accidents are bound to happen, so no one made plans,” Mr Nose says. “Now we have one.” The existence of risk is not a reason to abandon a technology, argues TEPCO ’s Anegawa Takefumi: “In ancient times, Prometheus gave us fire, and many people die from fires, but we accept that.” Anti-nuclear activists hold that the risks of using nuclear power in Japan, one of the world’s most seismically active countries, are prohibitive. “Using technology that has potential to destroy your society is insane—that’s the risk we’re talking about,” says Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace, a pressure group. The sudden promotion of nuclear power as climate-friendly strikes many in Fukushima as cynical. “We shouldn’t have to choose between climate disaster and nuclear disaster,” says Muto Ruiko, a local anti-nuclear campaigner. There is plenty of scope, anti-nuclear campaigners point out, to generate more renewable energy. After 3/11 the government introduced incentives for renewables and liberalised the electricity market. Though renewables now provide more than 20% of Japan’s power, their share would be higher still, argues Iida Tetsunari of the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, if the regional retail monopolies’ grip on the grid was loosened further and connections between regions expanded. He says a reform that came into force last year, obliging the big utilities to manage generation and transmission as separate units, has had little effect. “Local utilities people still use the same name-card, the same email address,” says Mr Iida. “The grid must become more independent.”

Plans released late last year foresee 50-60% of generation coming from renewables in 2050, with nuclear or fossil-fuel plants with carbon-capture technology providing the remainder. A clearer picture is expected this summer, when the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry releases a new triennial strategy for power generation. The minister, Kajiyama Hiroshi, has expressed support for more nuclear power. Even those who favour a renewable-powered Japan in the long term may accept a handful of restarts now, if that means closing coal-fired plants more quickly. Getting new reactors built would be much trickier, however, seeing that most Japanese people are against nuclear power.

In either case, oversight will fall to the NRA , which was set up specifically to prevent the sort of chumminess with utilities that allowed the failings at Fukushima Dai-ichi to go undetected or uncorrected. Fuketa Toyoshi, the NRA ’s chairman, is careful not to get embroiled in politics: “We believe we have to be independent of discussions in energy policy.”

Unfortunately for the NRA and for policymakers, one seismic change that has endured since 3/11 is a loss of faith in institutions in general. A yearly survey by Edelman, a public-relations firm, found that the share of Japanese expressing trust in their government plunged from 51% before the disaster to 25% after. It now stands at 37%. “This is the key problem: the loss of trust,” says Azby Brown of Safecast, an NGO in Tokyo that spearheaded independent efforts to monitor radiation after the disaster. “Trust is not a renewable resource. Once you lose it, that’s it.” ■

15,['The Economist'],"S ET IN THE bucolic countryside on the edge of Nashville, Christ Presbyterian Church is a stately building where, in normal times, hundreds of evangelical Christians gather to worship. On a recent Sunday a smaller, socially distanced congregation assembled to hear the preacher speak on the eighth chapter of the gospel of Mark, in which Jesus asks his disciples: “Who do people say I am?” Such questions of identity are troubling many in the congregation, too. Chatting after the service, Samantha Fisher, a mother of two who works in public relations, sums up the current moment: “I don’t know any more what it means to be a Christian and an American.”

White evangelicals like Ms Fisher are undergoing an identity crisis that has been a long time in the making, but has crystallised during four years of Donald Trump’s presidency and, especially, with the violent uprising at the Capitol on January 6th. Images of activists waving flags with Christian messages, praying in the name of Jesus inside the Senate chamber and claiming to defend America as “a Christian nation”, have left many evangelicals angry and confused. About 80% of white evangelicals supported Mr Trump in 2016 and at least 75% did so in 2020. The Pew Research Centre found last year that 59% of evangelicals felt the Trump administration had helped not hurt their interests. But conversations with a wide range of believers suggest that many churches are divided, and that support is not as overwhelming as the 80-20 split might suggest.

“For every evangelical I meet who supports what happened on January 6th, I meet 5,000 who do not,” says Scott Sauls, senior pastor at Christ Presbyterian. Leaders like him are trying to shift the focus of their churches, warning that putting too much faith in politics is not only spiritually misguided, but also self-defeating. “The culture wars are the greatest distraction from the mission of the church,” he says.

Evangelicalism is traditionally defined by four theological beliefs: the need for a spiritual rebirth (being “born again”); the centrality of Christ’s death on the cross to bring about that rebirth; the spiritual authority of the Bible; and an outworking of faith in missionary and social-reform efforts. The current reckoning centres on how to carry out that fourth belief and how much to stress political activism. “I think to some degree, there is an understanding in popular culture of ‘evangelical’ as referring to a personal relationship with Donald Trump rather than a personal relationship with Jesus Christ,” says Russell Moore, head of the public-policy arm of the conservative Southern Baptist Convention ( SBC ), who opposed Mr Trump.

A growing number of people are differentiating between the two. Ten days after January 6th Hunter Baker, the dean of arts and sciences at Union University, a Southern Baptist college in the town of Jackson, 130 miles west of Nashville, published an apology in which he declared that, though he had voted for him twice, he had “severely underestimated the threat posed by a Donald Trump presidency.” In an interview, he added: “I have been pouring myself into politics most of my adult life. I think now we need to focus back on the church and less on politics.” He says he will not vote for Mr Trump again. “I am not prepared to put the whole American order up for grabs. It is time to walk away.”

Some evangelical institutions, though remaining conservative, are also readjusting. Before the November election, the National Association of Evangelicals ( NAE ), one of the largest umbrella groups for the movement, representing millions of people in 45,000 churches from 40 denominations, released a statement resolving to “seek racial justice and reconciliation” and to “resist being co-opted by political agendas”. Many within the NAE are trying to represent a new type of evangelical, more intellectual, less white and less confrontational. Its new head, Walter Kim, holds a Harvard doctorate and is its first non-white leader. The chairman of its board, John Jenkins, is African-American.

Demography is having an impact, too. Robert P. Jones of PRRI , a think-tank, and author of “The End of White Christian America”, says that 22% of American pensioners are white evangelicals but only 8% of millennials are. Between a quarter and a third of evangelicals are not white, and many vote Democrat. Some of these shifts could start to influence politics.

And on the sixth day

The current moment is in some ways a replay of an earlier crisis. In the baking summer of 1925, outside a courthouse in Dayton, 150 miles east of Nashville, a teacher called John Scopes was charged with illegally teaching evolution in school. Scopes was found guilty by the court, though he was acquitted on a technicality and in the court of public opinion. The fundamentalism that underpinned the law was ridiculed, and the “monkey trial” became a turning point for American Christianity. Many strict fundamentalists withdrew from national life (though they remained strong in the South) while modernists, who questioned the literal truth of the Bible, became the mainstream.

Some theological conservatives, however, did not retreat. Intent on engaging with society, they created a third way after the second world war. It initially called itself evangelicalism, a word with roots in the Reformation, and it split into two strands. Divisions were messy but, broadly speaking, outside the South it sought to combine “deep, biblical reflection with social engagement, careful academic scholarship and a trust in science and reason,” says Mark Labberton, president of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena. It tried to steer away from literalist interpretations of the Bible, to support civic engagement and free itself from the more fundamentalist and overtly racist tendencies of its Southern cousins. One figure who became the face of the movement, and held sway in both strands, was Billy Graham.

After a period of political dormancy, however, the southern branch re-emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s with a social and political agenda. “A tsunami of fundamentalism washed over evangelicalism,” says Mr Labberton. This more tribal form of faith became synonymous with the word evangelical. Its leaders, such as Jerry Falwell senior and Pat Robertson, he says, claimed to be most faithful to the Bible, but were in fact “the ones with the loudest media voices” on issues such as abortion and homosexuality. Politics became its priority and, crucially, it was still infused with the racism and sexism of the old South.

In its current incarnation, some of this has morphed into a form of “Christian nationalism”, which says that America has been and should always be distinctively Christian. In their book, “Taking America Back for God”, Andrew Whitehead and Samuel Perry claim roughly half of evangelicals, by some definitions, embrace Christian nationalism to some degree (and often subconsciously). This kind of nationalism, say the authors, believes that non-Christian Americans are unable ever to be “truly American”. It also presents fertile ground for conspiracies.

A poll for the American Enterprise Institute recently found that 28% of white evangelicals believe in QAnon, a conspiracy suggesting that Mr Trump is locked in a battle with a cabal of depraved deep-state actors who want to ruin America. Numerous evangelicals contacted by The Economist, none of whom would speak on the record, said their church had split as a result. A deacon left a church in New England because the pastor did not urge people to vote for Mr Trump (“you now have blood on your hands”, she told him in an email). At a church in Seattle, the pastor was driven out by anti-maskers. At another church in the north-west a leader was fired for writing online that “this is not the gospel”, when Mr Trump posed with a Bible last year.

Now, though, the successors of the “third-way” evangelicalism of the 1950s are trying to reform the movement once again. When Bob Roberts, a pastor at Northwood church in Keller, a suburb of Dallas, realised his church did not reflect the diversity of his message, he promoted black and Hispanic leaders and linked with the local Muslim community, some of whom visited his church. A quarter of the 2,000-strong congregation left. “We are Christians not Muslims,” wrote one. Mr Roberts is no closet liberal. Pro-life and a member of the SBC , he insists: “I do not view the church as a tribe for white evangelicals.”

Many agree, and deplore Mr Trump’s character, but worry that Christians who vote Democratic, or who do not vote at all, are ignoring an even greater danger from the left, which they believe is about to steamroller people of faith. “Those people will soon be experiencing buyer’s remorse as the emerging oligarchy of politics, media, academia, woke business and high-tech threaten to create one-party national politics that undermines religious freedom and true democracy,” says Os Guinness, a prominent evangelical author of more than 30 books, who is also critical of Mr Trump. Mr Labberton is concerned about the radical left, too, but says Trumpism is “too blunt an instrument” with which to fight it.

Meanwhile, America is changing rapidly. The percentage of Americans who say they are Christians declined between 2009 and 2019 from 77% to 65%. White evangelicals declined from 20% to 16% in that time, says Greg Smith of the Pew Research Centre, though the share of white Protestants identifying as evangelical is higher in 2020 (56%) than a decade ago (53%). Ryan Burge of Eastern Illinois University says this may reflect more non-observant conservatives identifying as evangelical. From 2008 to 2019, the share of evangelicals who said religion was very important fell from 81% to 74%. One in ten self-identified evangelicals is Catholic, says Mr Burge.

Voices crying in the wilderness

The slow death of a culture can, however, lead to resurrection. In Oregon a group of Christian NGO s has sprung up, whose founders are theologically evangelical and socially conservative but have no links to politically conservative evangelicalism. The left-leaning state government is working enthusiastically with them. Ben Sand runs a group called Every Child, which mobilises communities to work with Oregon’s Department for Human Services ( DHS ). Three-quarters of the 1,500 families who became certified for fostering children in 2020 have come through Every Child.

“Evangelicals look at Oregon and say this is where God goes to die,” says Mr Sand. But having no cultural power can be helpful to the spiritual message, he says. “The best thing for the evangelical movement is for it to lose its cultural influence, because only in that context of humility, of going back to what matters most in the ethics of Jesus, will the church find its soul again.” The detachment of faith from right-wing politics appeals to Fariborz Pakseresht, director of the state’s DHS : “Perhaps this is what true Christianity looks like.”

Mr Sand says evangelicals need a more biblical definition of Christian victory, one that is not political. He and many of his millennial friends voted Democrat and he says that does not define them. Millennial evangelicals are no less socially conservative but many are less political. They are more racially diverse, care more about racial justice, immigration and climate change. The old battlegrounds such as gay marriage interest them less. “We lost the culture wars. I’m not fighting for a power I never had,” says John Mark Comer, an influential young pastor in Portland.

Mr Jones of PRRI says there are few signs yet that these shifts are filtering through into voting patterns. White evangelical backing for Republican presidential candidates has hovered around 75-80% for decades, he says. Even conservatives who did not like Mr Trump still voted for him. But he points to one PRRI poll after January 6th that hints at change: it asked if Mr Trump was a true patriot. Among white evangelicals, 66% agreed and 32% disagreed. “What would it mean if the 20% of non-Trump white evangelicals became a third of them?” he muses. “That would be a game-changer.” He is not sure it can happen, however, because modern evangelical culture has become so entwined with Republican power. But after January 6th and Mr Trump’s attempts to overthrow a fair election, says Mr Jones, “If there ever was such an opening this is it.”

Meanwhile, moderate evangelicals across the country, unheard amid the cacophony of cable news, continue to talk about “the radical centre”. “What evangelicals should be doing is calling both Trump and the far left back to the best of the first principles of the American experiment that made America great in the first place,” says Mr Guinness. He points to George Washington’s letter in 1790 to the Hebrew congregation in Rhode Island, whose rabbi had written to ask if the Jewish faith would be protected in the New World. “All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship,” replied Washington, before quoting the Old Testament prophet, Micah, saying that “every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.” ■","['movements', 'support', 'politics', 'evangelical', 'evangelicals', 'divided', 'political', 'christian', 'white', 'trump', 'mr', 'church', 'nations', 'god', 'donald', 'america']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
16,['The Economist'],"W HEN ANDREW YANG began his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, his proposal for a “Freedom Dividend”—monthly cash payments of $1,000 to be paid to all Americans—distinguished him among a crowded field as an outsider and an unorthodox thinker. Nearly two years later, as Mr Yang leads the race for mayor of New York City, his plan to provide cash to half a million New Yorkers feels far less radical, and not just because it is much more modest than his idea for a national universal basic income ( UBI ).

Though UBI still meets with scepticism in many quarters, the experience of the pandemic, and the accompanying explosion in social spending, have changed the tone of discussions about radical reforms to welfare states (see article). Cash transfers—like those deployed by many governments during the pandemic—have come to look like an efficient, effective way to meet any number of social needs. Few schemes during the pandemic offered recurring payments to all. Yet, though the age of the UBI has not dawned, the ordeal of covid-19 could have brought it closer.

Arguments for universal-income payments have flourished for centuries. Thomas Paine argued that the Earth is common property, and everyone who makes use of its land and resources owes society a “ground rent”, which should fund the payment of a “natural inheritance” to all adults. Plans for universal payments, and the subtly different idea of a guaranteed minimum income, were a recurring feature of welfare debates in the 20th century. Yet by the end of the century concerns about freeloading and persistently high rates of joblessness across much of Europe led to reforms that made benefits stingier or more contingent on work.

Worries about inequality and the belief—especially among tech types—that robots and artificial intelligence might soon make many workers redundant led to renewed interest in basic incomes in the 2010s. But realistic proposals were scant, Mr Yang’s plucky presidential bid notwithstanding. In 2016 a Swiss referendum on a plan to pay all adults an income of about $2,500 per month was soundly rejected, with nearly 80% of voters opposed.

Then came covid-19. Restrictions on activity placed huge swathes of society in a position of dire, urgent economic need. Governments around the world responded with a fire hose of cash. From mid-March to mid-June more than 1.1bn people received cash payments, much of which were approved with little political opposition. Cash transfers accounted for about a third of all pandemic-related social policies, according to the World Bank. America’s Congress passed a covid-relief act in March 2020 containing a provision to send no-strings-attached cheques of up to $1,200 to most adults by near-unanimous margins (another round of cheques followed at the end of the year).

Residents of Hong Kong received payments worth nearly $1,300; those in Japan about $930; most Singaporean adults roughly $425. Some governments experimented with payments that could be used only locally, through vouchers (as in Malta) or pre-loaded debit cards (as in parts of South Korea). But most simply sent cash.

Few if any of these schemes offered a true UBI , though. In the rich world, most cash-relief programmes were one-off transfers, aimed at stimulating consumption and cushioning against income shocks. In poor countries transfers more closely resembled a basic income, in that they were often recurrent. But most were aimed at the poor and vulnerable. In its biggest-ever welfare programme, the Brazilian government provided monthly payments to the poorest third of the population until December 2020. Togo’s scheme sends fortnightly transfers to the mobile wallets of informal workers where lockdowns are in place.

But as the end of the acute phase of the pandemic draws near, and normal economic activity slowly resumes, the number of programmes still in place is dwindling. Only 7% of policies have been extended; the average scheme lasted just three months, according to the World Bank. In America, President Joe Biden’s stimulus bill, which is working its way through Congress, makes provision for a third round of cheques, though fewer people will receive them than in 2020.

Pandemic assistance itself will not evolve into sustained basic-income schemes. But the world’s experience with covid-19 could still make their eventual adoption more likely. Polling suggests that young people in both America and Europe support UBI . Both Democrats and some Republicans have expressed support for an expanded child tax credit in America, which would provide cash with no strings attached to families on low incomes. Though benefits phase out for those on high incomes, the plan (which is part of Mr Biden’s relief bill) comes close to providing a basic income to families with children.

In South Korea, a presidential election contest scheduled for next year is shaping up to be a referendum of sorts on UBI . Lee Jae-myung, a potential candidate who as governor of the province of Gyeonggi oversaw a regional basic-income programme, suggests that South Korea should adopt a national-level UBI of 500,000 won ($430) per year, rising eventually to that same amount per month. (A possible rival for the presidency, Chung Sye-kyun, the current prime minister, opposes the plan.)

Pandemic experience also adds to a growing body of evidence on the effects of cash-transfer programmes. In response to the surge in interest in UBI , researchers and governments around the world launched a variety of experiments, at least some of which had begun to yield results before the arrival of covid-19. Finland, for example, conducted a trial in 2017-18 in which 2,000 randomly selected unemployed people were paid a modest income each month, roughly equivalent in size to unemployment benefits, which was guaranteed for the term of the trial.

Evidence from the experiment was muddied by a change to a law in 2018, which tightened conditionality for receiving unemployment benefits. Even so, the results are intriguing. Among the biggest worries relating to UBI is the possibility that it might discourage recipients from seeking paid work. Yet participants who received unconditional payments actually worked more than those on the dole. Reported well-being was substantially higher; recipients also registered less depression and stress, a higher degree of confidence in their abilities, and more social trust than did those in the control group.

The Finnish results are broadly consistent with findings from other experiments. Rebecca Hasdell, then of the Basic Income Lab at Stanford University, conducted a review of 16 basic-income studies published between 2009 and 2019 that covered rich and poor countries. The research provides consistent evidence of a positive effect on educational attainment and on measures of physical and mental health, and reduced poverty. Effects on labour-market participation are generally small; half of the studies that assess its impact do not find a statistically significant effect. Most of the rest find a positive effect, she writes.

Where participation does decline, though, it is often associated with an increase in caregiving, which could worsen gender inequality in the labour market. In low- and middle-income countries increased caregiving is often linked to lower workforce participation by women. In some studies, a basic income also seems to reduce participation by older workers.

In some cases the beneficial effects of UBI seem to have persisted through the pandemic. A team of economists that had begun a large-scale UBI experiment in Kenya before the outbreak of covid-19 was able to monitor its performance during the crisis. Recipients reported levels of well-being that were modestly but meaningfully higher than those of the control group. Effects on health outcomes were ambiguous. But people receiving payments were more likely to engage in risk-taking commercial activities: perhaps, the authors suggest, because of the insurance provided by the transfers. That suggests that even if basic incomes discourage some sorts of work, they may encourage other desirable activities, such as entrepreneurship.

Extrapolating from these findings is a fraught business. Studies of long-established systems with UBI -like features, such as Alaska’s Permanent Fund, which invests oil revenues and distributes dividends to the public, also indicate that the employment effects of a universal payment seem to be small (and may well be positive). But conclusions drawn from programmes that are limited in geographical or temporal scope may not fully capture the ways in which a large-scale, permanent UBI could affect society. Norms regarding work and leisure might adjust in ways that alter the response to payments—for good or ill.

Reality cheque

Behaviour could shift as more members of society receive generous income payments: perhaps because of a “social multiplier effect” which reflects the fact that some activities become more enjoyable as more people engage in them. That is, UBI recipients in, say, the Finnish experiment might have been more inclined to seek work because being in work is more attractive (and not being in work less so) when most people are employed—a dynamic that could potentially change were income payments to become universal.

Still, encouraging results from UBI trials are likely to encourage more experimentation. They may also provide support to principles and policies that share features with a UBI without going the whole hog, such as: universality; a relaxed approach to the question of work incentives; or a guaranteed income to some groups, as Mr Yang now proposes. That is because the most daunting obstacle to fully fledged UBI programmes remains: the little matter of funding. Mr Yang’s original proposal for a UBI, for instance, would have cost about 14% of GDP a year, though the price tag could be partly reduced by rationalising other welfare schemes. (For comparison, overall federal spending amounted to 21% of GDP in 2019.) Neither short-term UBI trials nor mass cash transfers in response to covid-19 required governments to take on the difficult task of financing enormous new expansions to the welfare state.

Much of the aid provided to households over the past year has been financed with new government borrowing, up to and including Mr Biden’s proposals. As accommodating as markets have been of government borrowing over the past year, it seems unlikely that UBI dreams can be made real without the question of financing eventually being asked and answered.

Some politicians are beginning to grapple with the issue. Mr Lee reckons that a small UBI in South Korea could be paid for by adjusting the existing budget, but he allows that increasing the generosity of payments would require additional money. Taxes on land, carbon emissions and digital services are his preferred funding mechanisms. Mr Yang, for his part, argues that a combination of curbs to spending inefficiencies and philanthropic donations could pay for his proposed cash transfers (which would cover only the poorest New Yorkers).","['transfers', 'work', 'income', 'mr', 'cheques', 'covid19', 'basic', 'universal', 'balances', 'ubi', 'pandemic', 'cash', 'pave', 'way', 'payments', 'world']",2021-03-02 00:00:00
17,['The Economist'],"O NE OF THE best explanations for the triumph of a “solution shop” like McKinsey was co-written by the late Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School in 2013. When hiring a management-consulting firm, he said, clients do not know what they are getting in advance, because they are looking for knowledge that they themselves lack. They cannot measure the results, either, because outside factors, such as the quality of execution, influence the outcome of the consultant’s recommendations.

So they rely on reputation and other squishy factors—the consultants’ “educational pedigrees, eloquence, and demeanour”—as substitutes for tangible results. On that basis, no one would hire Schumpeter to help fix McKinsey’s problems. His diagnosis is as lacking in eloquence as he is in demeanour. In his unschooled view, those of the firm’s 650 senior partners who voted to oust their global managing partner, Kevin Sneader, on February 24th, are in a clueless mess. Worse, they don’t get that they don’t get it.

The Byzantine voting system that has done away with Mr Sneader has not yet determined which of his two potential successors will replace him. Nor is it clear for what precisely the 54-year-old Scot is paying the price. Some see his departure as the firm’s strangled mea culpa; the ousting of a boss is typical of a firm engulfed in the sort of scandals Mr Sneader has had to cope with, from dodgy dealings in South Africa and settling conflict-of-interest lawsuits to paying almost $575m to settle claims that its advice helped exacerbate America’s opioid crisis. Yet the roots of all those crises predate his three-year tenure. He is, at most, the fall guy.

More likely, sticking his nose into his partners’ businesses to avoid future calamities could have rubbed enough of them up the wrong way that they voted against him. That would suggest that a majority cannot fathom how serious McKinsey’s problems are.

At heart, they stem from a simple delusion. Its partners see themselves as missionaries. Yet they are also mercenaries—“guns for hire”, as Duff McDonald, a biographer of the firm, calls them. They have a mantra that puts their clients’ interests above their own, and a belief, drawn from the firm’s pristine heritage, that no one knows better how to distinguish between right and wrong. Yet in some cases, as in working with Purdue Pharma, maker of the addictive painkiller OxyContin, their moral compasses go haywire. That is most likely because of the lure of lucre.

Numerous notes of dissonance follow from this. For almost 95 years, McKinsey has sought to portray itself as a genteel professional-services company, not a grubby business. Unlike, say, a profit-hungry Goldman Sachs banker, who walks into a room aware she may be hissed at, a McKinsey consultant expects his halo to be noticed. However much its senior partners insist that they are not motivated by outsized profits, they can earn as much each year as that Goldman banker. Revenues have roughly doubled in a decade to over $10bn. Partners number 2,600. The firm’s employees revel in the aura of the old McKinsey—of autonomy, discretion and intellectual prestige—while embracing the growth, profits and power that have come in more recent years. Rarely do they doubt whether they can have it all.

More people and more wealth inevitably make oversight more important. Still, McKinsey continues to think of itself as a partnership built on trust, not one that requires centralised command and control. Its voting system resembles an elite Athenian democracy. The more trouble it is in, the more it needs a Spartan leader, backed by a strong risk-control apparatus, to keep it on the straight and narrow. McKinsey’s 30-person “shareholder council”, its board of directors, may be too steeped in the firm’s cult-like culture to realise how pressing is the need for change. Mr Sneader started the reforms. His defenestration seems ominous for those hoping they will go much further under his successor.

As scrutiny of it intensifies, McKinsey must learn to balance preserving its discretion on behalf of clients with greater transparency. The more work it does for governments, the more public attention it will receive. Its costly legal encounters are bringing to light details of more client contacts, including with Johnson & Johnson, which last year settled an opioids lawsuit with a group of state attorneys-general. McKinsey’s settlements over opioids—in which it did not admit wrongdoing—require it to publish reams of correspondence, which increase the risk of reputational damage.

First, identify the problem

Within the cryptic world of McKinsey, what signs would indicate that the firm recognises the crisis that it is in? The winner of the run-off to replace Mr Sneader, which will reportedly be between Sven Smit from the Amsterdam practice and Bob Sternfels from San Francisco, should say which aspects of his predecessor’s reforms he intends to keep. More risk control is a must. Client payments should be more standardised. Most are flat fees (albeit fat ones) but about 15% are tied to performance; the latter create incentives for abnormally turbocharging results. Bruised by scandal, a truly progressive firm would launch its own version of a truth-and-reconciliation commission to see if anything else is lurking in the closet. It could shunt a generation of partners towards retirement. That would make it less unwieldy and make way for those more accustomed to the glare of publicity.

Above all, when it does open up, the firm should adopt some radical new talking-points. Rather than cloak itself in righteousness and assert its right to complete discretion and total opacity over how it behaves, it should admit that it exists to make cold, hard cash, and make explicit the ethical lines that it will not cross and the process it has to police them. Well-run companies confront and manage conflicts of interest. McKinsey has tried to blag its way through them with a narcissistic recklessness. Its partners like to think of themselves as the smartest guys in the room. They should have realised the perils of their self-delusion long ago. ■","['discretion', 'suffer', 'selfdelusion', 'mckinsey', 'firms', 'partners', 'firm', 'mckinseys', 'sneader', 'mr', 'schumpeter', 'results', 'collective', 'way']",2021-03-03 00:00:00
18,['The Economist'],"A S BEST AS scientists can tell, Neanderthals died out around 40,000 years ago. But they did not vanish from the Earth entirely. In the past decade it has become clear that Neanderthals mated with the ancestors of modern humans, and that at least some of those unions produced viable offspring. The upshot is that almost half of the Neanderthal genome still survives, scattered in small quantities among almost all modern people’s DNA . (The exception is those with mostly African ancestors, for Neanderthals seem never to have lived in Africa.)

Such genes have been associated with everything from hairiness to fat metabolism. Many seem to be related to the immune system, and to affect the risk of developing diseases including lupus, Crohn's and diabetes. A pair of recent papers suggest covid-19 belongs on that list as well. Two long sections of DNA , both inherited from Neanderthals, appear to confer resistance or susceptibility to severe covid-19, depending on which is present.

The work was led by Hugo Zeberg and Svante Paabo at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, whose researchers pioneered the study of Neanderthal DNA. Their first paper, published in Nature in September, described one Neanderthal DNA string, known as a “haplotype”, that is associated with a higher risk of serious illness. Having one copy of the haplotype, which is found on the third of the 46 chromosomes possessed by humans, doubles the chances of a trip to intensive care. Those unlucky enough to possess two copies—one from each parent—face an even higher risk.

That genetic bad luck is not evenly distributed. The gene-sequence is most common among people of South Asian descent, with 63% of the population of Bangladesh carrying at least one copy; and among Europeans, where the prevalence is around 16%. As expected, it is virtually absent from Africa. More strikingly, it is also very rare in large swathes of eastern Asia.

Exactly what the haplotype does is not clear. One gene within it encodes a protein that interacts with the cellular receptors that SARS - C o V -2 (the virus which causes covid-19) uses to enter cells and hijack them. The haplotype is also thought to be involved in the production of signalling proteins, called cytokines, that help to regulate the immune system. An overly aggressive immune response is one mechanism by which covid-19 kills.

On the other hand, some of those cytokines protect against cholera. The researchers speculate that may be why the haplotype is common in Bangladesh and India, where cholera has long been a problem. And there is evidence that, even as evolution has been boosting the haplotype in some populations, it has been working to remove it from others. “The frequency differences between South Asia and East Asia are so dramatic that we cannot help but suspect that past selection is responsible,” says Dr Paabo.

The second study, published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, concerns another Neanderthal haplotype, found on chromosome 12. Its effect is protective, though it is also less potent: having a single copy is associated with a 22% lower chance of critical illness.

This helpful sequence is more well-travelled than the harmful one. It is present in every part of the world except sub-Saharan Africa. Between 25% and 35% of the population of Eurasia carry at least one copy. In Vietnam and eastern China more than half the population are carriers. It also exists, at much lower rates, among American populations of mainly African descent, many of whom will have some more recent Eurasian ancestry as well.

Scientists also have a better idea of what it does, for it was known to researchers even before the news of its Neanderthal origin. The haplotype hampers the spread of RNA viruses, of which SARS - C o V -2 is one, by driving cells infected with them to self-destruct quickly. It is known to provide at least some protection against West Nile virus, hepatitis C and, intriguingly, SARS - C o V -1, which caused the SARS outbreak that began in 2002.

Once again, the hand of natural selection is visible. The genes in the chromosome-12 haplotype are found in other mammals, and have been lost several times in other species. That hints that carrying them comes at a significant cost, leading them to be removed if they are not being heavily used. That they are common in most human populations suggests RNA viruses have been a thorn in humanity's side for much of its evolutionary history.

The researchers hope that their work might help shed light on why some countries, and some populations within countries, appear to have been hit harder by covid-19 than others. They point out, for instance, that Britons of Bangladeshi heritage suffer severe covid-19 at roughly twice the rate of the general population. But disentangling the effects of DNA will be tricky. Age, obesity and sex, among other things, all influence the severity of covid-19. Comparisons between countries are complicated by definitional differences and the difficulty of performing accurate counts, especially in poor countries. Despite the prevalence of the harmful haplotype, the official covid-19 death rate in Bangladesh is just 5.1 per 100,000, an order of magnitude lower than in countries where the haplotype is much rarer.

Still, a reminder that genetics matter alongside those other factors is still useful. If covid-19 becomes an endemic disease, as seems likely, cheap gene sequencing may, in future, help doctors assess which patients are likely to be vulnerable to its worst effects. Understanding the mechanisms by which genes confer resistance or susceptibility may help with the search for drugs. And history suggests that SARS - C o V -2 is unlikely to be the last novel coronavirus to make the jump to humans. If some populations are likely to be more vulnerable than others, that is worth knowing for next time. ■

19,['The Economist'],"Studies of millions of people, with the same place and time, provide fairer comparisons than clinical trials do

A FEW MONTHS ago the biggest question about covid-19 vaccines was whether any of them would work. Today the problem in some countries is having too many to choose from. In Europe some people are spurning AstraZeneca’s jab, preferring to wait for Pfizer’s or Moderna’s instead.

Such preferences stem from the results of clinical trials. Moderna and Pfizer, which make the same type of vaccine, announced an efficacy of 94-95%, whereas Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca reported 63-66%. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, has maligned AstraZeneca’s jab as “quasi-ineffective” in older patients.

However, the gap in reported efficacy may say more about the trials than about the vaccines themselves. Some studies counted people with mild symptoms as positive cases; others did not. Those with lower reported efficacy used participants in countries where partly immune-resistant variants of SARS - C o V -2 are common. One tested only a single-dose regimen.

Fortunately, apples-to-apples comparisons are now possible, based on millions of people who got different vaccines in the same country at the same time. And recent data from Britain, which has given either Pfizer’s or AstraZeneca’s jabs to 20m people, paint a different picture from the trial results. Three studies show that single doses of the two jabs are similarly effective.

The latest paper, a preprint for the Lancet published on March 3rd, found that one dose of either jab is 80% protective against hospitalisation in people aged at least 80, starting 14 days after vaccination. Another study, in Scotland, included younger age groups and also found the two jabs had similar potency against hospitalisation.

For a virus seeking new hosts, this is bad news—which will only get worse. Few people in Britain have received second doses. However, Israel has almost finished a two-dose mass-vaccination programme using the Pfizer vaccine. According to the latest data from Israel, two doses are about 90% protective against any form of covid-19, including asymptomatic infection.

Pfizer’s jab is pricey and must be stored in freezers. In contrast, AstraZeneca’s is cheap and needs only normal refrigeration. If the AstraZeneca vaccine also matches Pfizer’s efficacy, which now appears likely, it could play a leading role in ending the pandemic—so long as people do not reject it based on ill-founded swipes from the likes of Mr Macron.■

20,['The Economist'],"T WO YEARS ago at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gabfest for buffs of geopolitics, Vice-President Mike Pence delivered to his largely European audience a stinging address, full of rebukes and America First swagger. On the same stage a few hours later, Joe Biden offered a glimpse of a brighter future. “This too shall pass. We will be back,” he said. The election in November seemed to fulfil his prophecy. President-elect Biden has vowed to restore the alliances damaged by Donald Trump. He has stuffed his incoming administration with familiar faces from the Obama years. As he prepares to take office on January 20th, Europeans are again daring to dream.

They are also drawing up to-do lists. A month after Mr Biden’s win the European Commission issued a detailed set of proposals for joint transatlantic action. A source close to the Biden team says it has “substantial alignment with our thinking”. That augurs well for what ought to be a formidable pairing. America and the European Union account for over 40% of the world’s GDP ; with Britain, nearly half of its defence spending; and huge regulatory and technological clout. But global challenges are growing and America faces fresh demands on its attention at home and in other parts of the world. Optimists say this bolsters the case for transatlanticism. But to stay relevant, the alliance needs renewal.

Under the Biden administration, transatlantic relations will fall into three baskets. First are the relatively easy wins. Start with the simple fact that Mr Biden is not Mr Trump. The outgoing president characterised the EU as a “foe” created to impoverish America, and used to dismiss NATO as obsolete. Mr Biden will rejoin the Paris climate agreement and revoke Mr Trump’s withdrawal from the World Health Organisation. A drawdown of troops stationed in Germany, announced last year, is unlikely to stand, and Mr Biden could lift Mr Trump’s tariffs on EU steel and aluminium. Europeans may find America keener to help reform the atrophied World Trade Organisation ( WTO ), and to resolve a long-running row over aerospace subsidies.

On security Europeans can expect a loud reaffirmation of America’s commitment to Article 5, NATO ’s mutual-defence guarantee, and more predictability in its policy towards Russia. Mr Biden has said he will seek to extend New START , a nuclear arms-control agreement with Russia due to expire on February 5th. The EU , with Britain, would also like to see America rejoin the deal they helped negotiate on Iran’s nuclear activity. Mr Biden has indicated a willingness to do so, if Iran complies with its terms. All sides are engaged in a complex diplomatic dance to increase leverage before negotiations start.

More ambitious ideas make up a second basket. Mr Biden has pledged a “summit of democracies” to face off against autocracies. Rather than a blockbuster event, this may look more like a set of principles to guide policy across a range of issues, capped with a low-key meeting at the end of this year. But corrupt European governments, both in and outside the EU , can expect a rougher ride. On climate the two sides may struggle to get beyond bromides. Co-ordination on carbon pricing will face high hurdles in Congress. European plans for a tax on climate-unfriendly imports risk American cries of protectionism.

Some German politicians hope to revive the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, an ill-fated Obama-era negotiation. Yet public attitudes on big trade deals have soured on both sides of the Atlantic. There may be more mileage in working on standard-setting and tax arrangements in other forums. “The Biden view isn’t a million miles away from the French idea of ‘managed globalisation’,” says Tom Wright of the Brookings Institution in Washington. A joint trade and technology council, proposed by the EU , could help push for common standards in new technologies such as AI . Other democracies could be invited to join.

In the digital sphere, although old tensions on data privacy and competition may flare up, Tyson Barker at the German Council on Foreign Relations ( DGAP ) notes a convergence as American regulators grow alert to the challenges of Big Tech. One tripwire is a tax on digital giants approved in several European countries; retaliatory tariffs are threatened against France’s. A recent report by the DGAP and the Harvard Kennedy School urges a 12-month moratorium on such actions while the partners thrash out a common approach inside the OECD , a rich-country club.

And the third basket? The two sides must soften tensions. Old American concerns that some Europeans, notably Germany, are delinquent on military spending will not end with Mr Trump’s exit, but nor will they be used to bludgeon Europeans into compliance. European efforts to share the security burden, including military mobility, cyber-defence and even anti-corruption, should find a receptive ear in Washington, especially if they can reduce tensions in the EU ’s neighbourhood. But French-inspired attempts to forge “strategic autonomy” in defence will meet resistance if seen as undermining NATO .

The threat of secondary sanctions by America on entities linked to projects disliked by Congress became a major transatlantic irritant in the later Trump years. Nord Stream 2, an undersea Russian gas pipeline, was often targeted: Congress recently handed Mr Trump the power to impose sanctions on firms linked to it. Should he exercise it before leaving office, Mr Biden will face an awkward early choice.

The burgeoning contest with China, increasingly threaded throughout American foreign policy, may prove the biggest transatlantic test. The EU sees China in part as a “systemic rival”, language that should open space for common action. Mr Biden says a “united front” would give democracies “substantial leverage” over China. Yet on December 30th the EU agreed with Xi Jinping the outline of an investment deal that drew criticism at home and in America (see Chaguan). Some Europeans boasted that this was “strategic autonomy” in action.

For all the grumbles, Mr Biden’s team does not expect the deal to forestall deeper transatlantic co-operation on China, including at the WTO . But a more focused American approach could leave Europeans with hard choices. They will resist American entreaties to decouple fully from China—indeed, many firms are beefing up their Chinese investments (see article)—or to apply a geostrategic test to all economic relations. Europeans themselves are split on China, notes Peter Beyer, the German government’s transatlantic co-ordinator. But they will be open to discussions on shock-proofing supply chains, building joint standards, and harmonising approaches to foreign investment and in some cases to export controls. The departure later this year of Angela Merkel, a champion of engagement with China, may shift the political balance in Europe.","['eu', 'american', 'european', 'europeans', 'transatlantic', 'trump', 'mr', 'america', 'biden', 'putting', 'repairing', 'rift', 'china', 'tricky']",2021-01-09 00:00:00
21,['The Economist'],"D URING THEIR 45-year feud, America and the Soviet Union fought proxy battles all across the world. But the cold war was at its most intense in Europe, where the Soviets constantly worried about their satellites breaking away, and America always fretted that its allies were going soft. The contest between China and America, happily, is different from that. For one thing, the two sides armed forces are not glowering at one another across any front lines—although in Taiwan and North Korea each has an ally in a tense, decades-long stand-off with the other. Even so, in the rivalry between the two powers, there will be a main zone of contention: South-East Asia. And although the region has drawn up no clear battle-lines, that only makes the competition more complex.

People across South-East Asia already see America and China as two poles, pulling their countries in opposite directions. Those protesting against the recent military coup in Myanmar, for example, hold up angry placards that attack China for backing the generals and pleading ones that beg America to intervene. Governments feel under pressure to pick sides. In 2016 Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, loudly announced his country’s “separation from America” and pledged allegiance to China instead. China’s claim that almost all the South China Sea lies within its territorial waters and America’s rejection of that assertion have sparked blazing rows in the main regional club, the Association of South-East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ), which China has attempted to win over.

This tug-of-war will only become more fierce, for two reasons. First, South-East Asia is of enormous strategic importance to China. It is on China’s doorstep, astride the trade routes along which oil and other raw materials are transported to China and finished goods are shipped out. Whereas China is hemmed in to its east by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, all firm American allies, South-East Asia is less hostile terrain, providing potential access to both the Indian and Pacific Oceans, for both commercial and military purposes. Only by becoming the pre-eminent power in South-East Asia can China relieve its sense of claustrophobia.

But South-East Asia is not just a way-station en route to other places. The second reason competition over it will intensify is that it is an ever more important part of the world in its own right. It is home to 700m people—more than the European Union, Latin America or the Middle East. Its economy, were it a single country, would be the fourth-biggest in the world after adjusting for the cost of living, behind only China itself, America and India. And it is growing fast. The economies of Indonesia and Malaysia have been expanding by 5-6% for a decade; those of the Philippines and Vietnam by 6-7%. Poorer countries in the region, such as Myanmar and Cambodia, are growing even faster. For investors hedging against China, South-East Asia has become the manufacturing hub of choice. Its consumers are now rich enough to comprise an alluring market. In commercial as well as geopolitical terms, South-East Asia is a prize.

Of the two competitors, China looks the more likely prize-winner. It is the region’s biggest trading partner, and pumps in more investment than America does. At least one South-East Asian country, Cambodia, is in effect already a Chinese client state. And none is willing to cross China by openly siding with America in the superpowers’ many rows.

However, as close as South-East Asia’s ties with China appear, they are also fraught (see article). Chinese investment, although prodigious, has its drawbacks. Chinese firms are often accused of corruption or environmental depredation. Many prefer to employ imported Chinese workers rather than locals, reducing the benefits to the economy. Then there is the insecurity bred by China’s alarming habit of using curbs on trade and investment to punish countries that displease it (see article).

China also dismays its neighbours by throwing its weight around militarily. Its seizure and fortification of shoals and reefs in the South China Sea, and its harassment of South-East Asian vessels trying to fish or drill for oil in nearby waters, is a source of tension with almost all the countries of the region, from Vietnam to Indonesia. China also maintains ties with insurgents fighting against the democratic government of Myanmar, and has in the past backed guerrillas all over the region.

This sort of belligerence makes China unpopular in much of South-East Asia—building, alas, on dismaying traditions of prejudice. Anti-Chinese riots often erupt in Vietnam. Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country, has seen protests about everything from illegal Chinese immigration to China’s treatment of its Muslim minority. Even in tiny Laos, a communist dictatorship where public dissent is almost unheard of, whispered gripes about Chinese domination are commonplace. South-East Asian leaders may not dare criticise China openly, for fear of the economic consequences, but they are also wary of being too accommodating, for fear of their own citizens.

China’s bid for hegemony in South-East Asia is thus far from assured. South-East Asian governments have no wish to renounce trade with and investment from their prosperous neighbour. But they also want what America wants: peace and stability and a rules-based order in which China does not get its way by dint of sheer heft. Like all middling powers, the big countries of South-East Asia have an incentive to hedge their bets, and see what favours they can extract from the Goliaths of the day.

22,['The Economist'],"O N THE MORNING after the polls closed last week, America withdrew from the Paris agreement on climate change. The effects will be short-lived. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to rejoin the pact as soon as he enters the White House.

Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.

Donald Trump’s defeat has evoked strong reactions around the world. The main one “is relief”, says Andreas Nick, a German MP . But the world will not return to how it was in 2016, and Mr Biden will not please everyone.

Consider climate change. Most countries are eager to welcome America back into the club of those that care about it. In the past eight weeks, China, Japan and South Korea have vowed to reduce net emissions to zero by mid-century or thereabouts. Four of the five largest economies have now committed themselves to emissions cuts that are in line with limiting global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels or less (see chart 1).

Mr Biden has said he intends to adopt a target of net-zero emissions by 2050, which modellers say will shave 0.1°C off their temperature projections for the end of the century. To rejoin the Paris deal, he will need formally to submit this goal alongside an updated national pledge to slash emissions. Most observers believe a 45-50% decrease from 2005 levels by 2030 would be tough but feasible, fair and commensurate with what Europe is doing. Mr Biden can re-enter the Paris deal without congressional approval, but he will need some degree of buy-in from both sides of the aisle to make his pledges credible. Integrating green infrastructure, energy, and research and development into any new government stimulus would help. American public opinion is broadly favourable. In exit polls two-thirds of voters said that climate change was a serious problem. Whether they will accept higher energy prices to fix it remains to be seen. Outsiders are watching to see if Mr Biden structures his team in a way that makes it clear that he wants to integrate climate action across his foreign and domestic policy. The importance of having America back on the climate train is hard to overstate. Over the past four years, voters around the world have noticed not only warmer temperatures, but increasing numbers of floods, droughts and forest fires. Europe is pushing through an ambitious green deal at home and working closely with China, the world’s largest emitter. If Mr Biden can formalise America’s emissions targets for 2030 and 2050 before the COP 26 UN climate summit next year, that will help convince other governments that the country intends to pull its weight. That should give others—including China—the guts to decarbonise faster. However, not all governments will welcome a carbon warrior in the White House. Oil- and coal-producers are wary. So is Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, not least because Mr Biden has threatened “economic consequences” if Brazil continues to tear down the Amazon rainforest. Mr Bolsonaro, who thinks foreign eco-scolds have imperialist designs on Brazilian territory, tweeted “OUR SOVEREIGNTY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE” and spoke vaguely of needing “gunpowder” to defend it. Brazil’s carbon emissions rose by a whopping 9.6% in 2019, mainly due to deforestation.

Another area where the world expects more collaboration is health. Mr Trump announced in July that America was pulling out of the World Health Organisation ( WHO ), the main global body for fighting pandemics (among other things), grumbling that it was beholden to China. Mr Biden says he will reverse this rash decision on the first day of his presidency.

By executive order, he can stop the clock on the withdrawal process, which was to be completed by July 2021. It is unclear how big the disruption will be. America is the WHO ’s biggest donor: in 2019 it provided around 15% of its budget. With Mr Biden in charge, America is also expected to join a global coalition funding the development of covid-19 tests, drugs and vaccines and their distribution to poorer countries. International co-operation is likely to work better than “America First”. The pandemic “won’t be over in the US if it’s not over in Mexico,” notes a Mexican official.

Governments everywhere are asking how Mr Biden will affect their national interest. China’s state media have given him a cautious welcome. Global Times, a tabloid, even called him an “old friend”. China’s regime may have relished the decline of American soft power under Mr Trump, but it also chafed at the capriciousness of his China policy and the hawkishness of his officials. In its view, the Trump administration is to blame for pushback in much of the West against Chinese influence.

China does not expect a Biden presidency to reduce Western anxiety. But it hopes for more predictability. Under Mr Trump, China feared a sudden policy shift towards Taiwan that might have brought the two countries closer to war. It hopes that Mr Biden will be more careful.

China would also like a less choppy trade relationship. It doubts that Mr Biden will ramp up tariffs in a futile effort to make bilateral imports equal to exports, as Mr Trump did. It hopes that he will cut some of those tariffs. It does not expect any change in America’s attitude towards Chinese involvement in building 5 G networks, or its military build-up in the South China Sea.

India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, was quick to fire congratulatory messages both to Mr Biden and to his running-mate. Kamala Harris inspires “immense pride” not just among her chittis (aunties) but among all Indian-Americans, Mr Modi gushed. Indian pundits speculate that he is keen not to be punished for having bet heavily on Mr Trump, his fellow populist.

He probably won’t be. Whoever is in charge, bilateral ties have warmed in recent decades. “The US cannot create an effective balance of power against China without India,” notes Ashley Tellis of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think-tank. Mr Biden’s campaign website took India to task for its backsliding on democracy and human rights. India’s unspoken retort, in the words of Sadanand Dhume of the American Enterprise Institute, another think-tank, is “Let us do whatever we like, because we are with you on China.”

When it comes to asserting hard power, America’s friends in Asia want Mr Biden to be closer to Mr Trump than to Barack Obama. Mr Obama drew red lines in the South China Sea, but then did little when China crossed them. The Trump administration, by contrast, more vociferously rejected China’s claims in the sea and upped the American naval presence. It reaffirmed America’s defence commitment to Japanese islands harassed by China. And it sold arms to Taiwan. Bilahari Kausikan, formerly Singapore’s top diplomat, says that when Mr Trump told President Xi Jinping of China, his guest at Mar-a-Lago in 2017, that he had just bombed Syria over its use of chemical weapons, he did much to restore the credibility in Asia of American power.

Say it ain’t so Joe

Some Asians worry that Mr Biden might make security concessions to China in pursuit of other goals, such as co-operation on climate change. Where Mr Obama “put emphasis on engagement first, it’s time to put deterrence first,” says Miyake Kunihiko of the Canon Institute for Global Studies, a think-tank in Tokyo. “They shouldn’t leave China with any illusions it would be able to attack Taiwan,” says Sasae Kenichiro, a former Japanese ambassador to the United States. Still, many would like to see Mr Biden approach China in closer co-ordination with allies, and with less blind rage. For all that Japanese policymakers wish to constrain their huge neighbour, they are, given China’s proximity and the two countries’ enmeshed economic ties, reluctant to confront it. They dread the kind of open break with China that the Trump administration has seemed bent on.

Japan’s new prime minister, Suga Yoshihide, surely hopes for a more conventional relationship with his country’s main ally. “It’s extremely important for us to have professional consultations with the United States, and with a head of government who is knowledgeable about foreign policy,” says Tanaka Hitoshi, a former deputy foreign minister. South Koreans would agree. Mr Trump tore up a trade deal and constantly threatened to withdraw American troops from Korean soil if Seoul did not pay more for their presence. Mr Biden, in an op-ed for South Korea’s national news agency, called such threats “reckless” and vowed to strengthen the alliance. In a poll before the election, almost two-thirds of South Koreans said they wanted Mr Biden to win. Likewise, in South-East Asia, Mr Trump’s calls for an ideological crusade against “Communist China”, to be fought on every front, showed an administration out of touch with diplomatic realities, argues Dino Patti Djalal, an Indonesian former ambassador to America, in the Diplomat, a magazine. Yes, China causes headaches in South-East Asia. But it has posed no ideological threat for decades. For now, he says, the region’s priority is to overcome the pandemic (with China’s help) and chart an economic recovery (in which China will be the motor of growth). The American presence is welcome, but having to take sides is not—which is why Indonesia recently refused to offer a home to American spy planes. As for Mr Biden, Asians are counting on a return of what Kevin Rudd, an Australian former prime minister, calls “strategic and economic ballast” to America’s relationship with Asia, and “a more nuanced diplomacy”. Is that likely? Mr Rudd thinks so. Mr Biden is pulling together a team of Asia experts for whom “the granularity of the Indo-Pacific is like second nature”.

During the Trump years the European Union ( EU ) unexpectedly found itself the guardian of multilateralism. After Mr Biden’s victory, Europeans hope this burden will be shared. Besides rejoining the Paris agreement, they would like America to stop undermining the World Trade Organisation and to revive the Iran nuclear deal. Mr Biden has suggested he will do so.

In grand strategic terms, the EU ’s main aim is to avoid being dragged into a hegemonic struggle between America and China. It wants to be slightly firmer and less credulous with China, but may not support Mr Biden if he pursues confrontation.

Mr Biden will not undermine NATO as his predecessor did. And he will insist that NATO allies, two-thirds of whom fail to spend 2% of GDP on defence, invest more in their own armed forces. Germany hopes that this message will no longer be accompanied by threats to slap tariffs on German cars, and that disputes between allies will be settled quietly, rather than over Twitter.

France hopes for a fresh American push to resolve regional conflicts that affect European security, from Turkish expansionism in the eastern Mediterranean to instability in Lebanon and Libya. Germany and France will welcome a return of American civility and seriousness, and an end to Mr Trump’s efforts to divide Europe.

Yet there is also a clear-eyed recognition in European capitals that, even under Mr Obama, Europe had begun to slip out of American sight. “The Americans are obviously indispensable,” says a French presidential source, “but the world has changed.” France now wants Europe to do more for itself, and differently. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, will need to persuade the Biden team that his ambitions to build up “strategic autonomy” in Europe are not aimed at sidelining NATO .

Not your average Joe

Britain hopes to secure a trade deal with America (to offset the damage done by Brexit) and to punch above its weight globally via its “special relationship” with the superpower. However, Mr Biden, who has Irish ancestry, has hinted that Britain can forget about a trade deal if it reimposes a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. He has described Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, as “the physical and emotional clone of Donald Trump”, which is not meant as a compliment. That Mr Johnson was the second world leader to speak to Mr Biden after his victory will allay some fears, but Britain will probably lose its role as the bridge between the United States and Europe.

In the Middle East reviving the Iran nuclear deal will not be easy. Most American Republicans and some Democrats revile it. Mr Biden may lift some sanctions and then try to negotiate a follow-up agreement. Israel and the Gulf states will want it to go much further than the original 2015 version—to impose limits on Iran’s ballistic-missile programme and perhaps its support for militant groups. Iran is unlikely to agree to such terms, though, in which case America’s Middle Eastern partners will urge Mr Biden to maintain the sanctions.

Mr Trump had a notable success in persuading Arab states to recognise Israel. Mr Biden will be under pressure to continue the thaw. Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, was close to Mr Trump, and will have to mend ties with Mr Biden. However, his country retains strong support in America. The Palestinians hope to reverse some of Mr Trump’s more antagonistic moves, such as closing their diplomatic mission in Washington and cutting aid. They are unlikely to convince Mr Biden to move America’s embassy in Jerusalem back to Tel Aviv. Most countries want Mr Biden to slow the drawdown of American troops from Afghanistan, where fighting between the government and the Taliban is intensifying, and to keep a foothold in Iraq, where Islamic State is active (see chart 3).

For the world’s populists and nationalists Mr Trump’s presence in the White House was evidence that theirs was the ideology of the future. “The value Bolsonaro derived from Trump was the narrative,” says Oliver Stuenkel of the Fundação Getulio Vargas, a university in São Paulo. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico’s left-wing populist president, has so far refused to congratulate Mr Biden. Viktor Orban, Hungary’s illiberal prime minister, supported Mr Trump on the ground that Mr Biden’s party stood for “moral imperialism”. Poland’s rulers did so for similar reasons. Janez Jansa, prime minister of Melania Trump’s native Slovenia, insisted for days that Mr Trump had won and retweeted fake news to that effect.

Back to life, back to reality

These countries now face a president who sees upholding the rule of law as a foreign-policy priority. As vice-president, Mr Biden repeatedly toured eastern Europe explaining that America saw corruption as a tool of Russian influence, and fighting it as crucial to NATO ’s security. Daria Kaleniuk of A nt AC , an anti-graft group in Kyiv, hopes Mr Biden will be “much stronger and more involved”.

Many autocratic leaders will miss Mr Trump’s tendency to overlook their sins. Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, will find his regular WhatsApp chats with Jared Kushner less useful. Vladimir Putin expects frostier relations. Hence, perhaps, the histrionics of Dmitry Kiselev, his propagandist-in-chief. “For a long time, they have been trying to teach us [democracy],” he said. “But now the teacher has staged a debauchery, smashed the windows and shit his pants.” Many poor countries hope that Mr Biden will notice them. Governments in Africa want support to deal with the economic fallout of the pandemic. Central America wants aid to curb violence and give people an alternative to emigration. Developing countries everywhere would like less bluster about a new cold war with China and more American trade and investment. Human-rights groups would like a vocal ally in the White House, or even a long-winded one. “We will clearly see a more serious voice on democracy and human rights in Africa,” says Judd Devermont of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank. “The Trump administration’s absence was most deafening on politics and governance.” Finally, the world expects America to welcome more foreign talent. Mr Biden vows to repeal Mr Trump’s toughest immigration curbs, stop building the wall, stop putting children in cages and offer a path to citizenship for people living in America illegally. Countries that send lots of emigrants, such as India, are pleased.

So are the migrants themselves. Arvin Kakekhani, an Iranian researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, designs catalysts to turn water and carbon dioxide into clean fuels. After Mr Trump’s “Muslim ban” he felt “so insecure”, not knowing whether he would be able to stay in the country, he recalls. He has had to live apart from his Iranian wife for two years. “My dream is to use expertise to tackle the climate crisis,” he says, adding that with Mr Biden’s victory, he is “now much more motivated to stay” and do it in America. ■

23,['The Economist'],"I N 2013 , after WikiLeaks revealed that the United States’ National Security Agency had bugged the phone of Dilma Rousseff, then Brazil’s president, Joe Biden called to apologise. A year later the American vice-president went to Brazil for a World Cup football match bearing a gift: declassified documents shedding light on abuses by Brazil’s military dictatorship of 1964-85. Ms Rousseff had herself been tortured.

Ms Rousseff called Mr Biden “a seductive vice-president”. Other Latin American leaders found him less so. Otto Pérez Molina, a former president of Guatemala, rues the day that he bowed to pressure from him to prolong the life of CICIG , a UN -backed graft-fighting agency. He expressed this regret in 2015 from a military prison, where he awaited trial on corruption charges. CICIG supplied the evidence.

Once Mr Biden has the top job, it would not be surprising if his interest in Latin America waned, given other demands on him. The only memorable vignette about the region in Barack Obama’s new memoir is his confession to “smiling and nodding” through a long dinner in 2011, thinking about the war in Libya while Chile’s president droned on about wine exports.

Still, Mr Biden will probably pay heed. He was Mr Obama’s point man for Latin America, visiting 16 times. Regional emergencies, from mass migration to Venezuela’s tightening dictatorship, will require his attention. He does not have Donald Trump’s bullying style. He will promote the rule of law and efforts to fight climate change, concerns that Mr Trump largely ignored. This year Mr Biden is due to host a triennial “summit of the Americas”.

Latin America has changed since his vice-presidency. Weak economic growth has undermined the region’s self-confidence. The pandemic has killed 541,000 people in Latin America and the Caribbean, second only to the death toll in Europe, and caused the worst economic slump in more than a century. The corrupt are winning the war on corruption. Anger at a broken social contract has led to unrest and the election of populist presidents. Venezuelans are fleeing their country, putting strain on its neighbours. Central America’s exodus, paused by the pandemic, has resumed.

Democracy is in retreat. The Bertelsmann Foundation, which ranks countries’ democratic strength on a ten-point scale, finds that the scores of seven democracies in Latin America have fallen by 0.8 points or more since 2010. Recently Peru’s Congress unseated the second of two presidents within 30 months. Nayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, has laid the groundwork for dictatorship. Elections in 2021, including in Ecuador, Peru and Nicaragua, could bring populists to power or consolidate authoritarians’ rule.

When Mr Trump took office in 2017, Latin American governments suffered a “fear of coming to his attention”, says a former adviser to his administration. But many grew to like him, largely because he left them alone, unless they allowed migrants to stream into the United States. His interest in promoting democracy did not extend beyond the left-wing “troika of tyranny”—Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, populists of the right and left respectively, felt a kinship with him (Mr Bolsonaro is an unabashed fan). Both waited a month to recognise that Mr Biden had defeated him.

Bidenworld thinks it wrongheaded to confine democracy promotion to three countries. It shares the pre-Trump consensus that the neighbourhood’s stability depends on the rule of law, a strong civil society and fairer capitalism. It will seek more humane ways to control migration than bullying governments to block migrants as they pass through their countries.

Mr Biden wants eventually to resume allowing asylum-seekers to apply in the United States. Now the Trump administration forces those who reach the border to remain in Mexico. Mr Biden is expected to unwind Mr Trump’s pacts with the three countries of the Northern Triangle—Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador—whereby the United States can send migrants back. That will be a slow process. A loftier goal is to make the Northern Triangle a better place to live in. Juan Gonzalez, who will join the National Security Council, was a Peace Corps volunteer in the highlands of Guatemala, origin of many migrants. Mr Biden wants to spend $1bn a year to improve conditions in Central America.

He will have to use sticks as well as carrots. Corruption is worsening in the Northern Triangle. Guatemalan lawmakers chased out CICIG ; legislators shut down MACCIH, its counterpart in Honduras. Mr Trump did not protest. This month American prosecutors named Honduras’s president, Juan Orlando Hernández, as a co-conspirator in a drug-trafficking case (he denies wrongdoing). The case shows the limits of spending on security and prosperity while the rule of law is weak, says Eric Olson of the Wilson Centre, a think-tank.

Mr Biden will resume the fight for better governance. American ambassadors will press governments to appoint honest judges and officials. Mr Biden’s administration may propose the establishment of an anti-graft agency for all of Central America, which would support prosecutors and attorneys-general but be less intrusive than CICIG and MACCIH . One lesson of Mr Trump’s successful bullying over migration is that the United States has great leverage in the region.

Mr Biden’s approach to the tyrannical troika will be less punishing, giving them fewer excuses for misrule. Like Mr Trump, he regards Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro as a tyrant. But he is likely to sabre-rattle less, work with other powers more and seek ways to alleviate the humanitarian crisis.

Antony Blinken, Mr Biden’s nominee for secretary of state, helped normalise relations with Cuba when he was an adviser to Mr Obama. Mr Biden will cautiously renew that policy, easing restrictions on remittances and tourism. The Trump administration’s decision this week to restore Cuba to the list of state sponsors of terrorism, alongside Iran, Syria and North Korea, raises the political costs of rapprochement. Mr Obama had removed it in 2015.

Climate change will be a new source of rancour. Mr López Obrador, who champions Mexico’s state oil monopoly and has spurned American renewable-energy projects, will face green pressure from Washington. So will Mr Bolsonaro, who has allowed destruction of the Amazon rainforest to accelerate. Mr Biden wants to create a $20bn fund to protect it, but Brazil, which interprets such initiatives as threats to its sovereignty, has so far rejected the idea. Relations between Mr Biden and Mr Bolsonaro, who praises the regime that tortured Ms Rousseff, are likely to be strained.

For him and some other leaders in the region, the change of gears in Washington may cause whiplash. Some will say the United States is in no position these days to lecture other countries. But, says an adviser to Mr Biden, the failure of attacks on American democracy shows the value of strong institutions. If the United States can overcome such assaults, it may be able to help its neighbours do the same. ■","['american', 'president', 'states', 'trump', 'joe', 'whiplash', 'mr', 'latin', 'america', 'biden', 'shift', 'united', 'rousseff', 'gears', 'waiting']",2021-01-14 00:00:00
24,['The Economist'],"Covid-19 has brought international travel to a standstill. But it will recover and may even become a better experience, says Simon Wright

L UGGAGE UNPACKS how international travel has changed down the ages. Adventurers in the 15th-century age of discovery set sail in galleons loaded to the gunwales with supplies for voyages that might take years. Aristocrats on a “grand tour” in the 18th century trekked around Europe for months in horse-drawn carriages packed with trunks, servants and even furniture. The suitcase arrived at the end of the 19th century when spending several weeks abroad became more common for the wealthy. By the 1970s tourists and executives needed to cart the wherewithal for a few nights away through vast airports. And so the wheelie-bag came to symbolise the era of mass travel.

The rise of the wheelie-bag reflects the falling cost and increasing speed of long-distance travel. Cheaper air fares, rising incomes and more leisure time have made foreign trips routine and a holiday abroad accessible to many in the rich world wishing to escape their daily stress. Travel brings new experiences and memories (or moments to capture on Instagram). And if not every mind is broadened, surely few suffer the opposite effect. As Mark Twain put it, “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness.”

The ease of travel has not just expanded tourism. As companies have spread across the world so have their workers. Business travel keeps multinational companies and supply chains connected. And the ability to get away has let people spread around the world to work, learn or just have a change of scene. As families have dispersed so has the need to keep in touch or attend weddings and birthday parties in foreign parts. It has brought the world together by allowing family and friends to live farther apart.

Yet until recently few people went far. Travel was slow, difficult and expensive when it relied on wind or horsepower. Steam and railways opened the gates a little wider. But getting far afield even 100 years ago took an ocean liner or airship, a pricey way to go. A first-class cabin on the Titanic in 1912 started at £30 ($3,500 today); a transatlantic ticket on the Hindenburg cost $400 in 1936 (both one-way, as it later turned out). The big surge in international travel came with flying. A train on the trans-Siberian route from Beijing to Moscow takes over five days; a flight around seven hours. Yet the real game-changer was cheaper fares. In 1950 only 25m people took a trip abroad, says the United Nations World Tourism Organisation ( UNWTO ). By 2019 the number of trips had grown to 1.5bn (and that excludes migrants, refugees and visits of over a year).

Nearly three-fifths of international travellers arrived and departed by plane in 2019, compared with only 5% by sea and 1% by train, according to UNWTO . The 35% of travellers crossing borders in a car were mostly Europeans, inhabitants of the world’s largest travel market, taking advantage of their continent’s small size and good roads. Going on holiday is the main motive for travel abroad, accounting for 55% of trips. Business travel made up 11% of the total. Most of the rest was to visit families and friends abroad. Some travel for religious reasons (2m Muslims visit Mecca every year); and around 15m sought medical treatment in 2017.

International travellers have filled tills for hotels, restaurants, car-hire firms and tour operators. Their spending hit $1.5trn in 2019. Before covid-19, travel contributed 4.4% of GDP and 6.9% of employment in the OECD rich-country club. International travel made up 6.5% of global exports in 2019, according to the World Trade Organisation. In all, travel and tourism accounts for over 330m jobs, one in ten of the world’s total, claims the World Travel and Tourism Council ( WTTC ).","['wheeliebag', 'travel', 'age', '2019', 'worlds', 'tourism', 'look', 'international', 'abroad', 'trips', 'pandemic', 'world', 'travellers']",2021-02-11 00:00:00

Exasperated cabin crew battling to close overhead lockers full to bursting with wheelie-bags, duty-free booze and laptop cases have been replaced by masked attendants presiding over planes two-thirds full at best and often with only a handful of passengers. Some report sleeping across empty rows of seats. The collapse of passenger numbers and revenues will damage the industry. Yet previous disruptions have shaken up the airlines to the benefit of the flying public. It could happen again.

The advantages of the previous big interruption to air travel, the second world war, are debatable. The experience of servicemen crammed into uncomfortably spartan transport aircraft, argues Eric Zuelow in his book, “A History of Modern Tourism”, created a generation without pre-war expectations of air travel as glamorous and luxurious. When those same aircraft were converted for civilian use, travellers accepted being packed in like sardines. The cattle-truck economics worked in passengers’ favour when deregulation brought competition to a previously highly regulated and often state-controlled industry. Air fares tumbled everywhere. Between 1995 and 2014 they fell by half in real terms, according to IATA, a club of the world’s airlines.

World wars aside, past crises have passed speedily. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the financial crisis of 2009 were “nasty shocks”, says Brian Pearce, chief economist of IATA , but “small bumps in the road” compared with covid-19. At its height in April 2020 flying was down by 94% over a year earlier, measured by total revenue passenger kilometres ( RPK s). Current estimates are that RPK s in 2020 will be down by 66% on 2019, when (including domestic flights) 4.5bn passengers took to the skies. Only 1.8bn people buckled up last year. By the end of it, some 30% of the global fleet was still grounded, according to Cirium, an aviation-data firm. And the sense of optimism that had slowly grown took a fresh hit early in 2021 as more transmissible and dangerous variants of the virus emerged, leading to renewed border closures and capacity cuts.

The plunge comes after years of bumper growth. In each 15-year period since 1988 RPKS doubled. They were expected to do so again between 2018 and 2033, according to Airbus, the European half of the duopoly that builds the world’s biggest passenger jets. Boeing, its American rival, notes an acceleration over the past decade, when growth averaged 6.5% per year, above the long-term average of 5%. Darren Hulst of Boeing is confident of an eventual return to a growth trend of 5% a year, even if over the decade from 2019 the number may be closer to 3.7%. In the meantime it will be a rough ride for airlines. Only 2.8bn passengers are expected to take to the air this year.

Signs of recovery are scant. Domestic flying in China and Russia has largely recovered, but in Australia it is still down by 86% and in America, the world’s biggest domestic market, it has fallen by 60%. International routes are suffering the most. Despite huge capacity cuts (only a quarter of the international flights scheduled a year earlier were still running in January), load factors are still low. Planes are often taking off a third full at most. The opportunity for travellers to stretch out comes at a heavy cost. Full service will not resume for a long while. Mr Pearce says the gradual deployment of vaccines merely makes him more confident about his baseline forecast of a return to 2019 levels by 2024. Not all air travel will recover at the same pace. Domestic flying will continue its rebound, followed by regional international traffic. The last part of the industry to refill its seats will be long-haul flying. This has a disproportionate impact on legacy airlines that still rely most on long-haul international routes. All airlines face a bleak period. Rather than increase by 4% on 2019 levels to $872bn, air-transport revenues in 2020 have plummeted to $340bn, reckons IATA . In a good year the industry makes an operating profit of $50bn. Losses for 2020 are forecast at $118bn and, even if the second half of this year sees a recovery, they will still be around $38bn in 2021. Airlines have responded by slashing costs, getting rid of staff and cutting fleets, yet carriers continue to burn cash at a rate of $5bn-6bn a month. Looking at the cash and liquid assets of carriers in mid-2020, the median airline had enough funding to last just eight-and-a-half months (or half way through this month), according to IATA . Some big names have succumbed. Norwegian Air Shuttle, one of Europe’s largest low-cost carriers, sought bankruptcy protection in November 2020. Dozens of smaller airlines including FlyBe, a British low-cost carrier, Virgin Australia and Avianca, based in Latin America, have gone to the wall.

Two types of carrier have the best chance of survival. Those with sound business models and strong balance-sheets, such as Ryanair in Europe, Southwest in America and AirAsia, are all low-cost carriers ready for a rebound. And legacy carriers, mostly propped up by governments, will keep their grip on long-haul flying when it returns.

Subsidies, subsidies

Support for airlines has been prodigious. Governments are used to helping airlines for reasons of national pride and to maintain international connections. Many countries in the Middle East, India and Africa cling to ownership of loss-making national carriers. Others are just returning to the orbit of governments. Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, has promised to “do what is necessary to guarantee the survival of Air France”. Germany’s Lufthansa has had a bumper aid package. America’s airlines, never shy to extend an upturned palm, benefited handsomely from its CARES stimulus act, signed into law in March 2020, which set aside $25bn in grants for airlines and the same in loans and guarantees.

The result will be an industry wallowing in debt and beholden once again to the state. Aviation Strategy, a consultancy, puts the total in 2020 of government support plus loans from banks, other investors and aircraft-leasing companies at $600bn, an increase of $170bn since the end of 2019. Keith McMullen, a partner at the consultancy, points out that most government aid has come in the form of loans, the terms of which incentivise rapid repayment. But the fragile state of the industry will make that tricky. European governments may then be obliged to swap debt for equity.

A return to the days before deregulation and the rise of low-cost carriers, when governments controlled national flag-carriers, set (high) fares and decided routes based on national goals rather than demand, is the fear of Andrew Charlton of Aviation Advocacy, another consultancy. America’s big carriers, Asian giants such as Singapore Airlines, and Lufthansa and Air France- KLM may be subject to government meddling. The terms of bail-outs for Air France stipulate that it must no longer compete with high-speed rail on some routes; Lufthansa’s decide what planes it may purchase.

That could give the low-cost carriers an advantage. Michael O’Leary, boss of Ryanair, admits to mixed feelings about state aid. Although it is “hugely distorting”, it is also likely to “sustain high-cost employment”, he says. And high-cost competitors are what he and his kind thrive on. Legacy airlines, already having to compete harder on short-haul routes and often weighed down by heavy pension-fund deficits, could struggle to adapt to an uncertain future that will require flexibility and nimbleness as well as lower costs.

Moreover, legacy carriers rely especially heavily on lucrative business travellers, a sector that may never recover fully, to subsidise seats at the back of the plane. If business customers and feeder routes dwindle, the complex web of domestic and international flights becomes harder to sustain, reducing connections and forcing up long-haul prices.

Not all will suffer. British Airways has slashed costs and raised capital and is fast-tracking its previous restructuring effort to compete with low-cost rivals. Other models look riskier. The Gulf carriers—Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways—that have grown swiftly in recent years may struggle. They lack a large domestic market to fall back on, unlike their Chinese competitors, and passengers may prefer not to mix with people from all over the world as they change planes at vast airports in the Gulf. If their model falters, the sky will be clearer for China’s state-controlled behemoths, which are already eating away at long-haul routes.

Low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Wizz Air, based in eastern Europe, sniff opportunities. Mr O’Leary has promised to slash fares to rekindle his business. His ability to compete with airlines under the heavy hand of the state will be helped by several factors. The availability of bargains from embattled planemakers and leasing companies will help carriers in decent health or with new business models. Ryanair confirmed an order for another 75 Boeing 737 MAXS in December, taking its total to 210. The plane’s grounding after two fatal crashes had led to cancelled orders, so a big vote of confidence from Ryanair was surely worth a hefty discount. Wizz Air, which relies on more robust parts of the market such as younger flyers and east Europeans going west for work and returning to visit family, also has big growth plans. Southwest, America’s biggest low-cost carrier, is in expansion mode as the country’s legacy carriers retreat. Tony Fernandes, boss of Air Asia, based in Malaysia, is “quietly optimistic” about 2021, and hopes to start three new airlines in the region.

A surplus of pilots where there was a dearth and unemployed cabin crew looking for work could also boost low-cost carriers. Once-scarce landing slots at busy airports may become more available. And, if prices rise for long-haul seats, this may rekindle interest in low-cost long-haul services, which have a patchy history. The demise of Norwegian was largely down to its inability to make profits on long-haul routes. The business model of short-haul carriers does not easily translate to long-haul flights, where fuel is a bigger share of costs and schedules are compromised by time differences and airport curfews that do not affect short-haul travel. But a new plane, Airbus’s A 321 XLR , a single-aisle jet with the ability to fly long-haul routes, could change the equation again.","['passengers', 'better', 'travel', 'industry', 'longhaul', 'covid19', 'carriers', 'routes', 'international', '2020', 'shake', 'lowcost', 'clouds', 'airlines', 'air', 'heads']",2021-02-11 00:00:00
26,['The Economist'],"S KIES CLEARED of much commercial aviation gave plenty of ammunition to those who see air-travel emissions as one of the gravest threats to the environment. Travel by commercial jet attracts more criticism than its 2-3% share of global carbon emissions seems to justify. Yet despite this seemingly modest contribution it is (or was, until covid-19 struck) one of the fastest-growing sources, the worst contributor of all emissions per kilometre travelled of transport and is likely to continue on its upward path. The growing ease and falling cost of travel, plus a lack of any regulations to curb emissions, means that unchecked a rise to as much as 9% of total carbon emissions by 2050 has looked plausible.

As far back as 2009 the airline industry pledged to cut emissions from flying by half from levels in 2005 by 2050. More recently flygskam (flight shame), a Swedish word that sums up a growing worry about the environmental impact of flying, protest groups such as Extinction Rebellion, whose followers have blockaded airports, and other anti-flying movements have all reminded the airline industry that for too long it has got away with failing to tackle the growth in carbon emissions.

The industry has adeptly managed to sidestep regulation. Aviation fuel is exempt from taxes on international flights, thanks to the Chicago convention, still the main rulebook for the industry even though it was agreed in 1944. In 2013 the EU tried to add international flights to its emissions-trading system, but the industry successfully resisted. As a compromise the International Civil Aviation Organisation, a UN agency, came up with CORSIA , a global scheme to offset emissions. Although criticised for its toothlessness—it is voluntary until 2027 and does not include domestic flights— CORSIA starts its pilot phase this year.

Yet carbon emissions per passenger have fallen by over 50% since 1990. New technology serving the commercial interests of airlines (fuel typically accounts for 15-20% of airlines’ operating costs) has had the side-effect of lowering emissions. Every generation of aircraft, such as the newest short-haul planes from Airbus and Boeing, is typically 15-20% more fuel-efficient than the one it replaces, mostly because of improvements in engines. Other bits of kit have helped. Airbus’s “sharklets” or Boeing’s “winglets”, the specialised wingtip additions on new planes, have improved fuel efficiency by 3-4%. Better business models, such as low-cost carriers that pack in more passengers, have ensured that aircraft are flying around with more people on board. Average load factors have improved by some ten percentage points over the past 15 years to 83% in 2019—though that was pre-covid. Emissions per passenger will fall further in the next few years, if only because flying is unlikely to return to levels of 2019 for three or four years. Cleaner skies will result from the early retirement of older, less efficient planes as airlines cut capacity. The oldest, most inefficient models such as the Boeing 747 jumbo jet and the Airbus A 340 may stay on the ground for good. Other older planes will be retired earlier and replaced with more efficient models.

Rail v air

The pandemic might even see some shift to rail, especially in Europe where trains and planes compete on international routes and an established high-speed network can be expanded. China’s domestic market could see similar competition between rail and jet engine. UBS , a bank, reckons that the use of high-speed trains could lead to zero growth in air traffic between European destinations from 2018 to 2028. Governments should be keen to invest in high-speed rail in Europe given their commitments to net-zero-carbon emissions by 2050. Further liberalisation across the EU will expose state-run incumbents to more competition.

Yet rail can never compete with airlines on long-haul routes that traverse large stretches of water. So a bigger leap to net-zero emissions from aviation has come to the fore. Airbus and Boeing, the duopoly atop the aircraft supply chain, have been clobbered by big losses, production cuts and fears for the financial health of their suppliers and their customers. Boeing’s woes have been compounded by the damage from the grounding of the 737 MAX for almost two years after two fatal crashes. The plane was eventually recertified for a return to service by American regulators in November. Yet the pair will continue to sell planes and these will largely replace older ones rather than expand fleets. So the share of newer, cleaner planes in the world’s fleets will grow.

Airbus and Boeing have gone further, with plans for aviation to clean up its act more comprehensively. The European firm hopes to have net-zero-emission planes that can ply short-haul routes in commercial service by 2035. The three concept aircraft it has unveiled, including a futuristic “blended wing” design, use hydrogen as a fuel. In January Boeing said that by 2030 it will start delivering commercial planes powered entirely by biofuels, another way to cut emissions. These are already in use in limited quantities by several airlines, blended with regular fuel, but are still prohibitively expensive—perhaps twice the price of kerosene.

Scale should bring prices down. And turning plant matter and waste into fuel has a carbon footprint of its own. Rolls-Royce, a jet-engine maker, nevertheless reckons a 75% reduction of carbon emissions is possible, with more to come. Other zero-emissions technologies are in development. Startups have been testing small battery-powered planes. Eviation, an Israeli firm, hopes that Alice, capable of flying nine passengers up to 800km, will fly for the first time next year. Others, such as ZeroAvia, are trying out fuel cells that use hydrogen to generate electricity to power engines.

Airbus expects its new plane to be powered by hydrogen directly as a fuel in new turbofans of the sort now found in large passenger jets. Big investments will be needed, starting with engine makers that must work out how hydrogen, which burns at a far higher temperature than kerosene, can be used safely. Boeing’s plans require some adaptation of existing engines. Given that new planes can take seven or eight years to get from drawing-board to commercial service, that gives Boeing what Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse, another bank, calls “breathing room”. Airbus is likely to launch its hydrogen programme formally in 2027. So gradually, after 2030 if the timetable holds, new planes will have far lower emissions and after 2035 short-haul jets should have net-zero emissions. The hydrogen technology could be extended to twin-aisle planes, all of which should be using more biofuels. No switch will be flicked but in around a decade the journey to clean up travel will start in earnest.■

27,['The Economist'],"B USINESS TRAVEL is as old as the traders who carted silks and spices between ancient civilisations. The executive tapping at a laptop as other flyers recline their seats and settle down with a glass of wine is a more recent phenomenon. The physical movement of goods on ships and planes and the supply chains that underpin global manufacturing and services firms rely on an army of businessfolk flying around the planet. But that army is in retreat.

Executives, diplomats and government employees, and NGO staff still trot the globe. Bosses of big companies often spend more time in corporate jets than with their families. At lower altitude workers travel to fit out factories, attend trade shows and conferences, launch new products or meet clients. Business class is a recent arrival. Airlines pitched it between first and economy class only in the late 1970s. Such travel has grown a lot in the past 25 years. According to Bernstein, an equity-research firm, total spending on international and domestic travel in 1995 amounted to $2.1trn, of which $400bn was for business. By 2019 around a quarter of the total, or $1.3trn, was spent on business travel.

Covid-19 has hit corporate jaunts hard. A poll in January by the Global Business Travel Association found that 79% of its members had cancelled all or most business travel. Credit Suisse reckons 2021 will see 65% fewer international business trips than in 2019. Bill Gates thinks the shift will be permanent. “My prediction would be that over 50% of business travel…will go away,” he says. That may be too pessimistic. The boss of one aviation firm sees a full return. Bernstein goes for up to 24% never coming back. Credit Suisse reckons 10-20% will disappear for good. Citi, another bank, plumps for 25%. Any recovery will be long in coming. McKinsey, a consultancy, points out that business travel rebounded more slowly than leisure travel after earlier disruptions, noting that after the financial crisis the number of international business trips from America fell by 13% (against 7% for leisure travel) and took five years to recover, compared with two years for tourism.

Every knock that travel has taken in recent decades has been followed by similar predictions of permanent decline. Each time it has failed to materialise. Why is this time different? Vaccines, fast-testing regimes and the dropping of travel bans might yet open the door for leisure travel. But Zoom, Google hangouts, Skype and other video-conferencing services have a better chance of permanently replacing business-class tickets, for several reasons. One is that companies badly hit by covid-19 will be under pressure to cut costs—and travel is an easy target. Second, a blizzard of pledges to cut carbon emissions and hit climate-change targets make cutting flying “low-hanging fruit”, says Paul Flatters of the Trajectory Partnership, a consultancy. Third, even though vaccines may reopen borders to many travellers, so long as covid-19 is at large firms will be reluctant to sanction trips not strictly required.

Some types of business trip are harder to conduct over a screen and so likely to revive. Vik Krishnan of McKinsey notes that these include sales and client meetings. Personal contact, especially when seeking new business, is hard to replicate digitally. And once one company resumes meetings in person, so will its competitors. Manufacturers will struggle to monitor remotely factories in far-flung corners of their supply chains. Trade shows and conferences that bring many people together in close proximity are more vulnerable, notes Bernstein. Hybrid shows, with some people present and others joining online may attract a larger audience who might otherwise have neither the time nor the excuse to attend, says Caroline Bremner of Euromonitor, a data firm. Plenty of low-level internal meetings will migrate permanently to the online world. One executive who has not flown in months happily notes that the sort of trip that required flying halfway around the world for one short meeting will go for good. Though the number of trips is likely to fall, their length may increase as executives try to fit in more, perhaps visiting several outposts in one country in a single trip.

If around a fifth of business travel never returns, that will have big consequences for airlines. Most accommodate some business travellers. Legacy airlines, which rely disproportionately on long-haul business customers, will suffer the most. But even low-cost carriers, which have targeted business travellers in recent years with flexible tickets at higher fares, will feel the pinch. Some 17m of easyJet’s 96m passengers in 2019 were flying on business, almost a fifth of the total and up from 10m in 2012. Southwest is even more reliant, with two-fifths of passengers paying business fares. But the mark-up over economy fares is generally lower than a legacy carrier’s price premium of three- to six-times as much as economy.

For the likes of IAG, Lufthansa and Air France- KLM , around 25-30% of revenues come from passengers flopping into business-class seats. A rule of thumb for legacy airlines is that business class comprises 10% of tickets, but 40% of revenues and up to 80% of profits. Citi reckons that every 1% fall in business custom knocks 10% off profits. Some airlines are trying to change how they operate. BA , which is part of IAG , is trying to sell business-class seats to leisure travellers, but it can never charge as much as to a late-booking executive. The secular decline in business travel will mean a smaller business cabin—and higher long-haul economy fares.

The likelihood that lucrative business travel will rebound more slowly than leisure is a blow to airlines that depend disproportionately on companies picking up the tab. A permanent decline will make life harder still. Yet for the executive who has had to spend weeks of every year on the road the chance to leave the wheelie-bag in the cupboard more often and settle down in front of a computer screen instead may come as something of a relief.■","['videoconferencing', 'executive', 'travel', 'fully', 'recent', 'business', 'rules', 'covid19', 'trips', 'total', 'travellers', 'leisure', 'airlines', 'flying', 'recover']",2021-02-11 00:00:00
28,['The Economist'],"C ORPORATE JETS are emerging from covid-19 in better shape than commercial ones. Bosses of big companies and the super-rich have long relied on owning or chartering their own small jets. As Jim Currier of Honeywell, a conglomerate, points out, business aviation suffered as much as commercial airlines at the start of the pandemic, but recovery has been “steady, consistent and at a higher pace”. The number of flights undertaken by scheduled airlines was down by 49% in 2020 on a year earlier whereas business flights were down by only 24%, according to WingX, a private-aviation data firm. Mr Currier expects a full recovery by mid-2021.

Economic jolts have taken a toll on business aviation, which had barely recovered from the financial crisis of 2008-09. Annual sales of new planes fell by almost half from a peak of 1,200 in 2008 to 700 a year, as the mood in boardrooms turned against corporate jets. But a health crisis is different to an economic one. Chad Anderson of Jetcraft, which sells new and used business planes, notes that second-hand planes have not been dumped on the market as in the financial crisis. With so many international flights grounded, executives and the ultra-rich may be joined permanently by the merely wealthy.

A new class of private traveller has emerged that Mr Currier characterises as those who used to fly first class but, though they can afford it, have not seen any value in chartering a private jet. It is a big step up in price, perhaps five to ten times, says Richard Koe, of WingX. Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of “first timers”, who want to avoid crowds on commercial jets and in airports, has doubled with covid-19.

Charter companies are doing what they can to hold onto these new clients by offering more flexible deals than the long-term commitments usually required. Mr Koe reckons that the outcome will be an industry that provides a more flexible on-demand service in future. But as private jets emit up to 20-times as much carbon per passenger as a commercial flight, the industry will also have to make more effort to introduce sustainable fuels, carbon-offsetting programmes, and hybrid and electric technology.

The mega-rich may also lead the way to the next step change in the speed of travel. Supersonic planes could cut journey times almost in half. Several are on the drawing board. Aerion, an American firm, hopes to have an eight-to-ten-seat supersonic jet on sale by 2025. Boom Supersonic plans a larger 55-seat all-business-class jet.","['flyers', 'supersonic', 'currier', 'business', 'ones', 'high', 'private', 'mr', 'corporate', 'flights', 'jets', 'pandemic', 'commercial', 'jet', 'hurt', 'planes']",2021-02-11 00:00:00

30,['The Economist'],"Why does The Economist call itself a newspaper?

When James Wilson published the prospectus for The Economist, a new periodical he planned to launch, he described it as “a weekly paper, to be published every Saturday”. To modern eyes the 19th-century black-and-white incarnation of The Economist is clearly a newspaper, and it looked very similar until the middle of the 20th century. The red logo appeared for the first time in 1959, the first colour cover in 1971, and it was only in 2001 that full colour was introduced on all inside pages. By the time the transformation from newspaper to magazine format had been completed, the habit of referring to ourselves as “this newspaper” had stuck.

Is The Economist left- or right-wing?

Neither. The Economist’s starting-point is that government should remove power and wealth from individuals only when it has an excellent reason to do so. When The Economist opines on new ideas and policies, it does so on the basis of their merits, not of who supports or opposes them. The result is a position that is neither right nor left but a blend of the two, drawing on the classical liberalism of the 19th century and coming from what we like to call the radical centre.

Where is your head office?

The modern, global version of The Economist was created in “the tower”, as journalists refer to the tallest of the three brutalist concrete buildings that make up the Smithson Plaza (formerly The Economist Plaza) in St James’s Street. Commissioned by The Economist and designed by Alison and Peter Smithson, the tower was our home from 1964 until the summer of 2017, when we moved into the Adelphi, a 1930s art-deco office block on the Embankment.

How has your logo evolved?

The corporate logotype of The Economist has evolved from the gothic lettering used on the cover of the first issue, published in 1843, to the box device designed in 1959 by Reynolds Stone, a British engraver and typographer. It now incorporates a font from The Economist Typefamily, a typeface created specifically for our use.

Editorial philosophy

Editorial practices

The Economist has been published since September 1843 to take part “in a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress”. This mission continues to guide our coverage: we publish it every week in the newspaper.

Our readers expect us to keep them well informed about the world. So each week in print and each day online we provide a carefully selected global mix of stories. Our news priorities are reflected in the sections that we include in the paper every week: these are both geographical (Britain, Europe, the United States, the Americas, China, Asia, Middle East and Africa, International) and thematic (Business, Finance and economics, Science and technology, Books and arts). By systematically sifting news in these categories we aim to ensure that readers miss nothing important. In addition, through leaders, briefings and special reports we strive to identify ideas and trends that will shape global developments—and keep us and our readers engaged in the “severe contest”. This approach underpins all our editorial output, across digital outputs and sister publications. Our stories offer a distinctive blend of news, based on facts, and analysis, incorporating The Economist’s perspective.

We do not attach ourselves to any political party. Our public agenda is liberal in the classical sense. We have supported free trade ever since our foundation in 1843 when we opposed Britain’s corn laws, which sought to keep the price of grain high by limiting imports. We have continued to advocate bold policies in favour of individual freedoms, such as same-sex marriage, assisted dying and legalisation of drugs, regardless of whether they are politically popular, in the belief that the force of argument will eventually prevail.

Ethics

The Economist strives for the highest ethical standards. Our approach falls under two headings:

Core principles

We should be honest, fair and fearless in gathering, reporting and interpreting information.

We are accountable to our readers, listeners, viewers and each other.

We steadfastly uphold our editorial independence.

We use objective data and research to inform our journalism. All our editorial output is fact-checked.

We apply classical liberal values transparently in our reporting and analysis.

We are transparent about conflicts of interest (see below). As an anonymous newspaper, we have to be especially beyond reproach.

Conflicts of interest

The editor-in-chief sets clear rules on conflicts of interest. These are reviewed and re-circulated periodically. Journalists know that the penalty for non-observance of the rules can be dismissal.

Our journalists should disclose any possible conflicts of interest, such as beneficial holdings, directorships and freelance engagements. The editor-in-chief keeps a registry of journalists’ interests, and updates it annually.

Any journalist wishing to accept a trip offered by a government, company or other entity must obtain approval by a senior editor. Such trips should be rare—for example, when a trip cannot be taken at our own expense, such as travel into a warzone.

Journalists arriving at The Economist from a partisan political job will not be allowed to write for some time about policy or politics in the country in which they held that job. Journalists covering politics or policy cannot contribute money or help to a political party or organisation in the country they are working in.

Facilitation payments to expedite or secure a government action are not acceptable.

Author anonymity

Most newspapers and magazines use bylines to identify the journalists who write their articles. The Economist, however, does not. Its articles lack bylines and its journalists remain anonymous. Why?

Part of the answer is that The Economist is maintaining a historical tradition that other publications have abandoned. Leaders are often unsigned in newspapers, but everywhere else there has been rampant byline inflation (to the extent that some papers run picture bylines on ordinary news stories). Historically, many publications printed articles without bylines or under pseudonyms to give individual writers the freedom to assume different voices and to enable early newspapers to give the impression that their editorial teams were larger than they really were. The first few issues of The Economist were, in fact, written almost entirely by James Wilson, the founding editor, though he wrote in the first-person plural.

But having started off as a way for one person to give the impression of being many, anonymity has since come to serve the opposite function at The Economist: it allows many writers to speak with a collective voice. Leaders are discussed and debated each week in meetings that are open to all members of the editorial staff. Journalists often co-operate on articles. And some articles are heavily edited. Accordingly, articles are often the work of The Economist’s hive mind, rather than of a single author. The main reason for anonymity, however, is a belief that what is written is more important than who writes it. In the words of Geoffrey Crowther, our editor from 1938 to 1956, anonymity keeps the editor “not the master but the servant of something far greater than himself…it gives to the paper an astonishing momentum of thought and principle.” The notable exception to The Economist’s no-byline rule, at least in the weekly issue, is special reports, the collections of articles on a single topic that appear in the newspaper every month or so. These are almost always written by a single author whose name appears once, in the rubric of the opening article. By tradition, retiring editors write a valedictory editorial which is also signed. But print articles are otherwise anonymous.

Different rules apply in the digital realm. We identify our journalists when they appear in our audio and video output. And many of them tweet under their own names. The internet has caused our no-byline policy to fray a little around the edges, but the lack of bylines remains central to our identity and a distinctive part of our brand.

Unnamed sources

We make use of unnamed sources and conversations on background because they can be more informative. We may withhold the name of a source who talks to us on the record, if that individual might be put in danger or legal jeopardy if their name is revealed or if we deem it otherwise unnecessary to name them. We strive to describe unnamed sources with as much detail as we think readers need to assess their credibility.

Fact-checking and corrections

Every single article we publish is checked for accuracy and credibility. We have a dedicated Research department to support this task.

Authors are expected to write with fact-checking in mind, and should be ready to provide source material and to discuss and respond to questions.

Our Research department works on edited copy as close to the final version as deadlines allow. We check against original sources that we believe to be reliable; for items that cannot be verified directly we form a view based on other credible information.

We also consider whether the context and presentation of the facts are fair.

We discuss queries with the author or editor. All queries must be resolved before a story is published. The final say on any matter rests with the relevant editor.

We’re not perfect, and occasionally we make an error. We aim to acknowledge serious factual errors and correct such mistakes quickly, clearly and appropriately. Online, published corrections should note what was wrong, what was put right and when. In print, we may publish a correction in the same section in a future issue of the newspaper. Readers who wish to bring potential errors to our attention are encouraged to email us.

Diversity

The Economist welcomes applications from people of all backgrounds, regardless of any characteristics—visible or invisible—or beliefs. We are convinced that drawing talent from a broad pool makes for better journalism and a better paper, and that breadth of perspectives and experiences leads to richer debate. Echo chambers of the like-minded do not. We are therefore actively and continually looking for new colleagues who can enrich our newsroom and help us produce mind-stretching journalism.

We have substantially intensified our efforts to attract candidates from a wider range of backgrounds. We have broadened the range of channels through which positions are advertised. We work closely with specialist organisations to reach applicants from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. Our selection process is designed to remove any unnecessary barriers to talented people. We require diversity in both gender and race/ethnicity in all shortlists.

To help hold ourselves accountable to our commitment to diversity, we have since 2017 published data on the composition of our editorial department by gender, and race and ethnicity. We realise that these metrics do not capture all measures of diversity, nor indeed all the forms of diversity we care about. As a British newspaper, our home city is London, where we hire and train most of our editorial staff, drawing on an international pool of talent.

Our idea of a good workplace is one where all employees feel at ease, are able to develop and grow, and get the flexibility and support that they need for a healthy work-life balance. We offer, and actively encourage, a range of ongoing development and training opportunities for all members of staff.

Ownership

The Economist has been editorially independent since it was founded in September 1843 to take part “in a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress”.

The share capital ofThe Economist Newspaper Limited, The Economist Group’s parent company, is divided into ordinary shares, “A” special shares, “B” special shares and trust shares. The company is private and none of the shares is listed. Its articles of association also state that no individual or company can own or control more than 50% of its total share capital, and that no single shareholder may exercise more than 20% of voting rights exercised at a general meeting of the company.

Ordinary shares are principally held by employees, past employees, founding members of the company and, more recently, by Exor NV. The ordinary shareholders are not entitled to participate in the appointment of directors, but in most other respects rank equally with the other shareholders. The transfer of ordinary shares must be approved by the Board of directors.

The “A” special shares are held by individual shareholders including the Cadbury, Rothschild, Schroder and other family interests as well as a number of staff and former staff.

The “B” special shares are all held by Exor which holds 43.4% of the total share capital of the company excluding the trust shares. Exor purchased the majority of its shareholding from Pearson plc in October 2015.

The trust shares are held by trustees, whose consent is needed for certain corporate activities, including the transfer of “A” special and “B” special shares. The rights attaching to the trust shares provide for the continued independence of the ownership of the company and the editorial independence of The Economist. Apart from these rights, they do not include the right to vote, receive dividends or have any other economic interest in the company. The appointments of the editor of The Economist and of the chairman of the company are subject to the approval of the trustees.

The general management of the business of the company is under the control of the Board of directors. There are 13 seats allowable on the Board, seven of which may be appointed by holders of the “A” special shares and six by the holders of the “B” special shares.

31,['The Economist'],"O N FEBRUARY 23RD , from a basement in Queens, New York, a little-known organisation announced that China would be receiving a special honour. “We present [the] People’s Republic of China with the H.R. 1242 Resilience Project W.E.B. Du Bois Award,” wrote the group’s president, Victor Mooney, in a letter to the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations. The award celebrates China’s donation of the Sinopharm covid-19 vaccine to African countries. “W.E.B. Du Bois is a vivid reminder that China is a brother to Africa and African-Americans,” Mr Mooney added.

In a time of strained relations between America and China, Mr Mooney’s olive branch is unusual. But then so is Mr Mooney. He claims to be the first African-American to have rowed across the Atlantic, braving boat-slapping sharks and boat-pinching pirates (the international arbiter of such challenges, the Ocean Rowing Society, does not recognise his efforts). He is an ally of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea, Africa’s longest-serving despot. Perhaps it then says something that it is Mr Mooney alone who is trying to resurrect a long-forgotten friendship between black activists and the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ). His award harks back to a time when figures such as Du Bois, to some the godfather of the civil-rights movement, looked to China to lead a Third World liberation struggle, which included black Americans. Today, however, only the faintest echoes remain.

For black radicals looking to smash racism and capitalism at home, “Red” China was once a “vision of Utopia”, says Keisha Brown of Tennessee State University. In contrast to the Soviet Union, it was an example of an independent, non-white nation, and its revolutionary leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, was an icon. Radicals rushed to go there. Langston Hughes, a poet, wrote his anti-colonial poem “Roar China!” after visiting Shanghai in 1933. Du Bois, a brilliant sociologist who became a staunch defender of Chinese communism, spent his 91st birthday lecturing at Peking University. His wife, Shirley Graham Du Bois, an activist in her own right, died in China in 1977.

A Chinese connection was also crucial to the Black Panther Party’s early successes. With a capitalist streak which might have got them purged in China during the Cultural Revolution, they bought battered copies of Mao’s “Little Red Book” in Chinatown for 20 cents each. Then, beneath the arches of Sather Gate, they sold them to Berkeley students for a dollar. “We made a killing,” recalled one of the group’s co-founders, Bobby Seale.

Today it is black radicals in the Bay Area who are most nostalgic for what China once represented. Tyson Amir grew up in East Oakland, the son of Black Panther affiliates. He travelled to China in 2018 to follow in the footsteps of his “elders”, who raced to “beat Nixon” to China in 1971. Sanyika Bryant, another Oakland-based activist, used to keep a photo of Mao and Robert Williams, a black-defence leader, as his screensaver. (The picture also holds a darker meaning. At the start of the Cultural Revolution, Williams, dependent on the CCP for his upkeep, watched helplessly from his Beijing apartment as his sons’ teachers were marched down the street by Red Guards.) But “there’s a lot of people, especially younger organisers, who have no clue about this history,” he sighs.

Candace McKinley, an organiser in Philadelphia, is one such example. She read about Du Bois in middle school, but his Chinese connections have not influenced her activism. She cares about the “global struggle of anti-capitalism”, but scarcely thinks about China. “I don’t see it as a model, or a place I want to go,” she shrugs.

This is partly because China has changed. As authoritarian as it was under Mao, it is now capitalist (albeit with Chinese characteristics), and no longer a wellspring for revolutionary ideas. Outwardly, however, it still aspires to a revolutionary foreign policy. It continues to make overtures to Africa, such as its latest attempts at vaccine diplomacy. After the death of George Floyd in 2020, its diplomats attacked American racial discrimination and police brutality at the UN , echoing Mao’s statements in support of black Americans in 1963 and 1968. But in America such gestures have largely fallen on deaf ears. For the few who know about China, racist attacks on Africans in China and a whiff of political opportunism have undermined the solidarity message.

Zifeng Liu of Cornell University sees some evidence that, in the minds of radicals, old cold-war attachments still remain. Many are reluctant to criticise China’s treatment of the Uyghurs, for example, because, by cold-war logic, that makes you pro-American, he explains. Even Ms McKinley, although “not a supporter of the CCP ”, is “sceptical” of the Hong Kong protests. She equates that movement for democracy with a movement for capitalism.

Back in New York, Mr Mooney remains confident that he is the man to revive Sino-Black relations. He hopes to travel to China once the pandemic lifts, to present his award in person. “My mother used to say, ‘Victor, you don’t need a football team to score a touchdown’,” he says. It is just as well. He will not find too many clamouring to be on his team.■","['forged', 'red', 'award', 'american', 'university', 'du', 'mooney', 'mr', 'black', 'radicals', 'bois', 'links', 'chinese', 'china', 'communists']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
32,['The Economist'],"T HE BUILDING at 833 Bryant street in San Francisco’s trendy SoMa neighbourhood will be unusual. To start with, all the inhabitants of its 146 units will previously have been homeless. Its constituent parts will have been prefabricated, constructed miles away and fitted together on-site like puzzle pieces. Most unusually, the project will have been cheap to build, at least by Bay Area standards. A report by the Terner Centre at University of California, Berkeley found that, once completed in July, the project will cost 25% less per unit than comparable ones.

That is an achievement in California, where per-unit construction costs for supposedly affordable housing have ballooned since 2000; they are now the highest in the country. Subsidies for below-market-rate housing come with strings attached. Affordable developments that take public funds may be forced to install solar panels, contract with small businesses, or enlarge balcony spaces: well-intentioned demands that nonetheless drive up costs. Builders need to work with a patchwork of local and state agencies that sometimes impose unclear or inconsistent requirements.

Mercy Housing, the builder of 833 Bryant, was able to avoid these headaches. The project’s funders, Tipping Point Community and the San Francisco Housing Accelerator Fund, prioritised low costs and a short timeline, sought no return and imposed few requirements on the builders. The project was thus able to avoid many of the problems that plague affordable housing developments. But it still faced the high construction costs endemic to all new housing across the state.

California tells developers of some affordable housing to pay labourers a “prevailing wage”, which is set by the state and can be nearly twice the median wage for a given trade. Prices for some materials have risen sharply in recent years and labour shortages have driven up wages, especially for skilled workers. Developers say that the Bay Area’s high housing prices exacerbate this problem: the region is too expensive for many construction workers to live in.

State and local permit-allocation makes projects even more expensive. In San Francisco neighbourhood organisations can challenge building permits, disrupting construction. Across the state, developers quake at the prospect of litigation under the California Environmental Quality Act ( CEQA ), a law dating from 1970 that can be deployed to block new housing. Since property tax increases are capped by law in California, some cities raise revenue by levying “impact fees” on developers that can exceed $150,000 per unit. Though no single factor accounts for high costs, says Paavo Monkkonen, a professor of urban planning at UCLA , the combination results in “death by a thousand cuts”.

To keep construction costs down, 833 Bryant has taken advantage of technological wizardry, which the Bay Area is known for, and innovative governance, for which it is not. The use of modular housing allowed work to continue on site while units were assembled elsewhere. The project also benefited from a streamlined review process made possible by California Senate Bill 35, which passed in 2017. SB 35 set a 90-day deadline for cities to approve qualifying projects, shielding it from challenges under CEQA and precluding the interminable back-and-forth that drives developers in California mad.

These innovations and more like them are sorely needed. According to a report by McKinsey, a consultancy, California faces a shortfall of 3.5m homes. San Francisco’s neighbour across the bay is already charging ahead. On February 24th, Berkeley’s city council voted to do away with single-family zoning. Lori Droste, Berkeley’s housing-wonk vice-mayor, hopes this will open the city up to new construction, driving down prices. SB 35, she says, has already streamlined the development of affordable housing.

San Francisco should follow suit. Even with the well-documented exodus of tech workers, the Association of Bay Area Governments estimates about 55,000 new units will be required every year to meet demand. In 2020 San Francisco added just 4,000. The 146 units in 833 Bryant show that it can be done.■","['houses', 'developers', 'units', 'build', 'possible', 'hammer', 'bay', 'housing', 'area', 'project', 'affordable', 'costs', 'construction', 'cheaply', 'san', 'california']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
33,['The Economist'],"I T LOOKED LIKE good timing at first. On February 27th the House of Representatives passed the maiden legislative hope of President Joe Biden, a behemoth $1.9trn package for covid-19 relief. It was speedy because it was unimpeded by any serious bipartisan negotiating—the legislation mirrored the White House’s proposal almost exactly, with not one Republican vote to show for it. That left more than two weeks for the Senate to pass the proposal before a self-imposed March 14th deadline, when emergency federal unemployment benefits for 11m Americans from the last round of stimulus will start to expire. Unfortunately for the president, smooth-sailing legislation has a habit of getting stuck in the Senate. A brittle Democratic majority and obscure parliamentary procedures in the chamber promise a lengthier drama.

Perfect party unity among Democrats would be needed to achieve a simple majority in the Senate. (It would be an unexpected coup for Mr Biden if even a single Republican voted in favour.) For normal legislation, that would spell instant defeat because of the filibuster, a parliamentary procedure that raises the effective threshold for passage to 60 votes out of 100. To get round this, Democrats are using a special procedure known as budget reconciliation. Reconciliation is filibuster-proof—but at a high cost. Legislation must pass a strict, Talmudic standard known as the Byrd rule, which requires consulting an oracle of sorts (an unelected official called the Senate parliamentarian). This triggers a bizarre-sounding series of events: the edicts of the parliamentarian usually result in a “Byrd bath” with the purged provisions (“Byrd droppings”) unceremoniously discarded.

Already, one probable casualty of the Byrd bath is the ambition to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Because reconciliation is meant to apply only to budget bills, and to exclude regulatory changes with “merely incidental” effects on taxing or spending, the parliamentarian advised against including it. Some Democrats have suggested simply overruling the parliamentarian by a majority vote. “It could not be more clear that we should not be allowing these minoritarian mechanisms from a bygone era,” says Mondaire Jones, a progressive Democratic congressman from New York, who has urged Kamala Harris, the vice-president who formally presides over the Senate, to overrule the advice. The administration, and thus by proxy Ms Harris, has looked askance at that manoeuvre in public statements.

Even aside from the maddening rules debate, the American Rescue Plan, as it is formally called, may return to the House a bit slimmer. Conservative Democrats like Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia have suggested fat to cut: more modest unemployment benefits than proposed ($300 in top-ups rather than $400) and more targeted distribution of another round of stimulus cheques worth $1,400 per adult (which currently would be given in full to Americans making less than $75,000 per year).

The $350bn in proposed bail-outs to state and local governments may also be shrunk, as moderate Democrats point out that state and local tax revenues did not decline nearly as much as feared. Overshadowing these intra-party negotiations between moderates and progressives is the clear precariousness of the plan. If any Senate Democrat were to withdraw support, the legislation would almost certainly collapse.

Both chambers must eventually agree on an identical text. How much moderates can remove before triggering a progressive revolt in the House is as yet unclear. So far, the left flank of Democrats has not been as obstructive as the right flank of Republicans was during their time in the majority. But the threat of only five breakaway votes in the House would be enough to threaten the bill and force negotiations. America would then have another maddening spin on the stimulus merry-go-round.■","['majority', 'senators', 'plan', 'senate', 'trimmed', 'house', 'stimulus', 'legislation', 'parliamentarian', 'slimming', 'tips', 'byrd', '19trn', 'democrats', 'round', 'reconciliation']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
34,['The Economist'],"“DO YOU MISS me yet?” asked Donald Trump. After an ignominious and uncharacteristically quiet exit from the White House—following an attack on the Capitol on January 6th by his incensed supporters, who sought to overturn the results of the presidential election—the former president emerged from his purdah on February 28th. The venue was the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an annual gathering of activists that once sat at the far right of Republican thought, but now appears to be its centre. For most of its history, the event was held just outside Washington, DC. This year it migrated to Orlando, in Mr Trump’s new home state of Florida, where adulation greeted him.

At the start of the conference, supporters paraded a golden statue of the former president through the convention hall; during his speech, the crowd chanted, “We love you.” The veneration affirmed what has become clear since Mr Trump left office: there is no Republican civil war. He spurned the idea that he would form a separate party to advance his agenda. Why would he need to, he asked? “We have the Republican Party.”

Loss has not altered Mr Trump’s demeanour. He continued to insist he had actually won the presidential contest. Emboldened by a party that has thrown its lot in with a rejected president (anomalous in the modern political era), Mr Trump continued to reiterate, without any new evidence, that his defeat was fraudulent. The commitment to this belief is complete. “We’ve been doing a lot of winning,” he said in the opening minutes of his 90-minute speech, peppered with the usual rally hits—such as whinges about trade deficits with China and bird-killing wind turbines—and spiced up with some new ones: some of the biggest applause came when Mr Trump expressed support for new laws, introduced by Republicans in dozens of states, to make voting harder.

Traditionally, ex-presidents settle into elder-statesman roles, criticising their successors sparingly, if at all. Mr Trump unsurprisingly shattered that norm. He painted Democrats as bent on destroying America. President Joe Biden, he argued, had a plan to “cancel border security” and invite millions of illegal immigrants across open borders to destroy American life. Mr Biden’s failure to quickly open schools was a cave to teachers’ unions (Mr Trump called it the “most craven act of any president in our lifetime”). The Democratic Party is really a Trojan Horse for socialism and eventually communism. The delegates lapped it all up.

Mr Trump also unsubtly teased a future presidential run. Once the party recaptures Congress in midterm elections in 2022, he mused, “a Republican president will make a triumphant return to the White House, and I wonder who that will be. Who, who, who will that be? I wonder.” He also asked attendees to support his fledgling political operation, which will become a vehicle for him to intervene in primary fights. Already, Mr Trump has endorsed the opponent of a Republican congressman in Ohio who voted to impeach him, and he called out the names of every single Republican in Congress who had done the same, applauding efforts by state Republican parties, which have become increasingly aligned behind him, to censure them.

Given the adulation of the most committed Republican voters, most of whom still approve of the former president and tell pollsters they will take their primary voting cues from him, once critical Republicans have turned accommodationist. Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, initially condemned Mr Trump for his alleged complicity in the assault on the Capitol, but has since doggedly defended him. He credited the ex-president with boosting the number of Republicans in the House, and for attending rallies while ill with covid-19. “Listen—we’re going to continue to do exactly what we did in the last election,” he promised from the same stage Mr Trump spoke from one day later.

All of this reinforces Mr Trump’s pre-eminent position atop the GOP. The distinction between Republicanism and America First Trumpism is growing ever smaller. The party’s fondness for free trade, for instance, and principled scepticism of state power are long gone, provided they are the ones wielding that power. For as long as the party’s primary voters remain devoted to their leader—and as long as officials who are privately Trump-sceptical think that the president’s coalition will help them beat Democrats—there is no reason to think that this hold will be broken. Dutiful Republicans have already introduced measures that seek to tighten voting rules in 45 states, according to the Brennan Centre for Justice, a think-tank at New York University. That reinforces Mr Trump’s unsubstantiated theory that Democrats could have won only by cheating. Republicans’ scepticism of democracy, which began while Mr Trump was in the White House, is not about to slow now that he is outside its gates, clamouring to be let back in.","['voting', 'president', 'house', 'trump', 'emerges', 'mr', 'donald', 'republicans', 'trumps', 'party', 'white', 'coming', 'republican', 'seclusion', 'second', 'crowd', 'adoring']",2021-03-01 00:00:00
35,['The Economist'],"W HEN DEMOCRATS enacted the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) in 2010, they wanted to limit costs to keep moderates on board. Hence the ACA , which gives subsidies to people who do not get health insurance from their employer to buy it on government-run exchanges, restricts its benefits to people who earn less than four times the federal poverty line. For an individual, that currently comes to $51,520 a year. But in the partisan donnybrook surrounding the bill’s passage, little attention was paid to the fact that the benefits cut off at the margin rather than sloping down. Policy wonks consider such “subsidy cliffs” risky: they can incentivise people to earn less in order to safeguard their benefits.

Eleven years later, Democrats have a chance to fix the problem. A covid-19 relief bill which the House aims to vote on this week would increase the ACA ’s subsidies and extend them to anyone who would otherwise have to spend more than 8.5% of their income to buy a benchmark plan. Smoothing out the cliff this way, says the Kaiser Family Foundation ( KFF ), a health think-tank, could help about 8m people.

The cliff is tallest for people aged 55-64, who face high premiums but are too young for Medicare (the universal health-insurance programme that kicks in at 65). Under the ACA ’s rating system, a typical “silver plan” for a 60-year-old who earns $51,000 a year costs $417 a month with subsidies. If their income rises to $52,000 they lose the subsidies, so the cost jumps to $871 a month. Because many ACA beneficiaries are self-employed or part-timers, they have volatile incomes. Some accidentally exceed the eligibility limit and have to pay back thousands of dollars in credits.","['subsidies', 'obamacare', 'covidrelief', 'aca', 'month', 'limit', 'plan', 's', 'income', 'overdue', 'earn', 'cliff', 'health', 'bill', 'fix', 'democrats', 'smooth', 'smuggled']",2021-02-27 00:00:00
36,['The Economist'],"T O THE DELIGHT of campaigners and some parents, covid-19 has put a wrench in school exams. With support from the Trump administration, all 50 states cancelled accountability testing last March, freeing 51m public-school pupils from the annual rigmarole. The SAT s optional essay-writing section and separate subject tests were discontinued this year. The Programme for International Student Assessment, an exam measuring the academic performance of OECD member countries, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ), a nationwide exam administered to a sample of American pupils, have been postponed too. With opposition building for years against standardised testing in public schools, could this be the end?

Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.

On February 22nd the Biden administration said exams had to take place, but that the results would not be used to grade schools. Ordinarily the federal government obliges states to hold schools accountable for their pupils’ test scores. Schools with poor results may see their budgets reduced, as part of that exchange of exam results for dollars. Some states and districts have used results to close schools and fire teachers. Teachers in tough places often think this is unfair. And covid-19 has strengthened the point that much of what goes into a test score is, frankly, well beyond the control of teachers.

Abandoning testing could be disastrous, warns the Fordham Institute, a think-tank, in a recent report. Cancelling tests again would make it hard to know how schools fared during the pandemic. “I would personally be in favour of more effort to get as many kids as possible tested, so that we know what is going on,” explains Cory Koedel, who co-wrote the report. “I think some kids are actually probably doing OK . And some kids are doing really terrible. And I don’t think we know exactly who’s who.” Others disagree. Derek Briggs of the University of Colorado Boulder’s School of Education questions the benefit of testing students during these trying times. “Isn’t it reasonable to assume that every student probably has had a suboptimal learning experience?…All students are going to need some serious help over the next year to make up for what’s been a pretty tough year and a half,” he says.

That thought delights those parents and teachers who have been waging war against standardised exams for years. The Opt Out movement gained national attention in 2015 when New York State participation dropped by 20 percentage points because families refused the exams. Thirteen states received warning letters from the Obama administration for failing to test at least 95% of pupils that same year. The activists in the Opt Out movement want to see others held responsible for student learning, not just teachers. “The notion that we can ascertain…the extent to which [pupils are] doing poorly as a function of what’s happening in schools, as opposed to everything else that’s going on in their lives right now is absurd,” says Daniel Koretz of Harvard’s School of Education.

One compromise would be for a representative sample of children to sit the tests. One group could be selected to take maths and American history, while another group took English and science. Each group would take two exams, the burden of testing would be reduced, but schools and the government would gain reliable information on four subjects, at least. ■

37,['The Economist'],"A GOLDEN IDOL of former President Donald Trump is on display this weekend at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the premier annual conference for Republican and conservative lawmakers, activists and media talking heads. Mr Trump is expected to give a keynote speech on February 28th in which he will deride President Joe Biden’s immigration policy and, perhaps, announce his candidacy for the 2024 Republican nomination. There can be no doubt Republican voters will welcome their leader back to public life with open arms, given the stranglehold that loyalty to Mr Trump has over the party.

A survey conducted by YouGov for The Economist found that 30% of adults who identified themselves as Republicans, or Independents who leaned more toward the Republicans than the Democrats, said they would “definitely” vote for a candidate for Congress or governor who had been endorsed by Mr Trump (see chart). An additional 29% said that they would be more likely to vote for someone endorsed by the former president than one who had not been.

38,['The Economist'],"T HIS WAS a big week for Montgomery County Public Schools ( MCPS ). The elected board that runs Maryland’s biggest school district held its first in-person meeting since it closed its 208 schools more than 11 months ago. No one should accuse its eight members (a couple of whom attended remotely) of taking covid-19 lightly. Montgomery County, where your columnist’s three offspring attend (loosely speaking) public school, is on track to be the last of America’s 14,000 districts to return pupils to the classroom.

Provided the board does not put the brakes on its latest back-to-school plan, as it has three times previously, Lexington’s two sons in elementary school will be back in school—for as little as four days a fortnight—by the beginning of April. His 12-year-old will go back on the same part-time basis three weeks later, by which time he will not have seen a teacher in the flesh for almost 14 months.

A comparison with their British cousins, who have missed half as much school despite enduring a second lockdown, shows how extreme this is. Most European countries fully reopened their schools in September. Only a handful of American states, including Florida and Texas, were even close behind them. And the laggard districts elsewhere are mostly still hanging back, especially in Democrat-run states such as California and Maryland, even as evidence of children’s limited potential to transmit the virus has piled up. Nationwide, about 25m American schoolchildren, or half of the total, are either in school part-time or fully on Zoom.

This failure is likely to have dreadful consequences. Lexington’s sons have two parents able to work from home and dedicated teachers (Miss W’s upbeat karaoke routines and Miss T’s coolly relentless maths drills are still going strong nearly a year into the great school shutdown). But the costs in lost teaching-time, social interactions, and the creative sparks that fly in a well-run classroom are obvious and mounting in his household. And they will be weighing even more heavily on less adaptable or fortunate ones. Test results point to rising rates of truancy and plummeting attainment rates in maths and English, especially among poor minorities, who tend to be least able to deal with remote learning and most afraid of returning to school.

Unprecedented as this failure may seem, its dynamics will be familiar to weary school reformers. An education policy that prioritises learning would have made returning children to school its objective, and worked through the impediments to it. (Face masks and open windows, it turns out, do most of that.) But this is not how the fragmented public school system works. The elected worthies who sit on its powerful school boards do not pursue objectives so much as balance competing local interests. This is a recipe for risk aversion and inertia or, as MCPS ’s wry superintendent, Jack Smith, puts it “not decision-making but mush”.

This week’s MCPS meeting illustrated the pressures inherent in the mush-making. It opened with a litany of video messages from concerned school users. “Imagine yourselves in a Zoom class wading through a fog of mental illness,” beseeched an exhausted-looking Zoom mom. “The teacher I am most concerned about getting sick is my Dad,” said a schoolboy. “He might recover or he might not make it.” “My husband saw schools operating safely in Somaliland! Why can’t we do that here?” asked another mother. Outside the MCPS office, rival crowds of protesters, pro-and and anti-reopening, meanwhile stomped on the icy pavement and honked their car horns. “There is a lot of anxiety on the board,” Mr Smith had earlier intimated. “Hundreds or thousands of people are going to have an opinion about you and post it everywhere.”

Cutting through these local forces takes unusual leadership or leverage, or both. Maryland’s Republican governor, Larry Hogan, has been trying to shame the state’s school districts into reopening for weeks, to no effect. By contrast, Bill de Blasio, who as the mayor of New York has rare authority over America’s biggest school district, pushed its schools to reopen despite fierce union complaints. With a Republican legislature at his back, Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, was similarly effective in threatening Florida’s school boards with financial penalties if they failed to unshutter—a threat Mr Hogan cannot credibly make.

A growing tendency towards single-party rule in the states may make that sort of strong-arming more common. Yet the polarisation driving it generally does not make for good policy. The eagerness of Mr DeSantis and other Republican governors to reopen schools was plainly well-judged. Yet it was part of a broader effort to follow Donald Trump’s lead and diminish the pandemic’s dangers that was anything but. Hence, for example, Mr DeSantis’s petulant sabotaging of local efforts to encourage mask-wearing.

By the same token, excessive caution among Democrats was fuelled by hostility towards Mr Trump. Science, which Democrats cite often but selectively, has been another victim of that stand-off. Its misuse has fostered the false dichotomy aired by many: that teacher health and student welfare are irreconcilable.

While America’s decentralised system has in some ways helped it through the pandemic, the sprawling, underperforming, historical accident of an education system has been exposed by it. It is too localised to be efficiently managed, and at the same time increasingly riven by national politics. That is the worst of both worlds, a reality President Joe Biden appeared to accept when he recently rowed back on his former pledge to get the kids back to school. It is not in his power to do so. And much of the system, in Republican or jealous union hands, is opposed to his influence.

Break’s over

Meanwhile, millions are left hoping the worthies and hobbyists on their school boards come through. The past year has not been all bad chez Lexington. It has been wonderful to see so much of his offspring as their childhood races away. It has been interesting to observe their lessons.

39,['The Economist'],"There are plenty of reasons to be hopeful. But the virus is not beaten yet

I N A SENSE 500,000 is just a very big number. It is not even accurate, given that perhaps 100,000 American deaths from covid-19 were never counted. And yet every one of them was someone: grandpas and great aunts, old friends and new, neighbours and workmates. Many of them died alone.

Grief was President Joe Biden’s theme at the White House on February 22nd, as he remembered 500,071 Americans lost to the pandemic. Warning his compatriots against seeing “each life as a statistic or a blur”, he said that there was “nothing ordinary about them”. At five o’clock the Stars and Stripes was lowered to half-mast for five days while 500 votive candles flickered on the steps of the South Portico.

In just over a year the pandemic has killed Americans on the scale of a world war or a decades-long catastrophe, like the opioid crisis (see chart). In absolute terms no country begins to compare—Brazil, which comes next, has yet to log its 250,000th death. In relative terms America has recorded 151 deaths per 100,000, fewer than Belgium, Britain, Italy and Portugal, but among the most severe.

One question is what went wrong. America is home to many of the best medical scientists and, in the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the world’s most respected public-health institute. Politics was partly to blame. Donald Trump helped turn science and public health into an arena for partisan combat. Successes, like the Warp Speed vaccine programme, were undermined by failures such as making face-masks a test of political affiliation. But politics alone cannot explain why fatalities in America are so much higher than in Japan, a country full of old people that has registered only six deaths per 100,000. A full accounting will also have to weigh other factors, including diabetes, obesity, care for the elderly, public health in an unequal country and genetics (see article). The other question is whether the worst is past. Recorded infections in America are 70% below their peak in January. Deaths, which lag behind by a few weeks, are down by about 40%. The rapid fall is hard to grasp because it is governed by the same exponential dynamics as the sudden climb in cases in November. Again, complex factors are at play, including immunity acquired through infection and vaccination, and the precautions people take as infections mount, both because they are required to and because they sense that it is not the best time to need a bed in hospital. There are reasons for optimism. Vaccination of the most vulnerable is proceeding apace, which should further reduce deaths and hospital admissions. The emptying of intensive-care wards will lower fatalities among those who do succumb. Treatments are improving. But the virus is not done yet. Modelling for the San Diego area, reported recently in the journal Science, suggested that, owing to the spread of a more transmissible variant of the virus first found in Britain, immediately relaxing social distancing there would cause a vicious surge in cases.■

40,[],"Three tips for mastering text completion on the GRE

One of the more recent additions to the Verbal Reasoning section of the GRE is text completion, which will test your ability to revise passages of varying lengths (in some cases, entire paragraphs) by selecting the correct words to complete multiple sentences. In this format, the GRE does not award partial credit, so you’ll need to select all of the correct words to complete the corresponding passage. Here are three easy-to-follow tips to help you do exactly that:

Break the text up into pieces

The length of text completion questions – especially questions that consist of an entire paragraph – can be difficult to digest all at once. Don’t add any additional pressure to take in all the information in one pass. Before you consider any of the answer choices, break the text up into smaller chunks and digest each piece one at a time.

While this might appear counterintuitive to our next strategy, understanding smaller sections of each question will help you avoid getting tripped up by tricky vocabulary words that are not necessarily essential to the sentences. More importantly, your understanding of these smaller chunks will also make it far easier to connect the dots and see the relationships between each piece.

Understand the big picture

We alluded to this earlier, but since you’ll need to correctly complete each sentence in the text completion questions, you’ll also need to understand their relationships with one another. Let’s take the following example into consideration:

John’s final essay covered the works of such ________ figures in American Literature as Poe and Emerson, comparing them to the less obviously ________ words of Donna Tartt.

Blank 1:

established esoteric counterrevolutionary

Blank 2:

well-known canonical nuanced

You’ll notice that each choice for both blanks would be grammatically correct if selected. However, the keywords “less obviously” in the second half of the sentence indicate that we need to identify two words similar in nature. We also see that John’s essay discusses three novelists, two of whom are responsible for a number of American classics and the other who is not quite considered in the same regard. The sentence does not discuss the writers’ notoriety, however, allowing us to eliminate “nuanced” as an option for Blank 2. Since Tartt’s novels are far less sacred than Poe and Emerson, we land on “canonical” as the right choice for Blank 2. Often times, attacking a text completion question out of order makes it far easier to complete the passage, which is the case here. Using “canonical” as a basis for Blank 1, we quickly find that “established” is its closest counterpart and should be our answer choice.

In this case, if we had not taken the time to understand the sentence was addressing literary figures of differing merit, we very easily could have selected any of the answer choices. It would have been easy to assume one of the seemingly “large” vocabulary words was the correct answer choice, but establishing the big picture of the sentence helped us avoid making that mistake.

Insert your own words

Once you’ve broken a passage down and understand its big picture, attack the question by inserting your own words, even before considering any of the answer choices for either blank. Let’s take another look at the example we discussed earlier. We’ll begin by inserting words that are used far more often in everyday conversation.

John’s final essay covered the works of such ________ figures in American Literature as Poe and Emerson, comparing them to the less obviously ________ words of Hilary Mantel.

Since we already know we’re looking for two words similar in nature, let’s use the word “historic” for both blanks. We don’t wind up with a sentence that’s necessarily exciting or complex, but it is correct from a grammatical and content perspective. More importantly, we can now use this to find the closest match to “historical” in each of the answer choices, which would point us again to “established” and “canonical.”

With enough practice, these tips will not only help you answer text completion questions accurately, but turn them into a more enjoyable challenge, too.

41,[],"GRE Statistics: the four most important concepts to know

The thought of dealing with statistics questions on the GRE can make even the savviest of test-takers cringe. Worry not: in this blog post, we’ll walk you through four integral GRE statistics concepts—mean, median, mode, standard deviation—so you can tackle them with confidence on exam day.

1. Mean

A ‘mean’ is the average of a set of numbers. Let’s take a look at the set below, which outlines the number of cookies a group of people can eat over the course of a night.

Bob: 12

Ralph: 14

Steve: 10

Carla: 8

To find the mean, simply find the total number of cookies the group as a whole could eat over one night: 12 + 14 + 10 + 8 = 44. Then divide the total by the number of people involved: 44 ÷ 4=11, which is our mean.

2. Median

A median is the value of the midpoint of a sequence. When you are given an odd number of items, all you’ll need to do is identify which number lands in the middle. To refresh your memory, consider the example set below.

2, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16, 23

A quick scan of this set tells us that the middle number is 9, making it our median. When you’re looking at an odd number of items, it really is that simple. However, let’s add another number to the end of that sequence.

2, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16, 23, 32

Although 9 and 12 both could be considered to be in the “middle” of this sequence, that’s not exactly the case. To find the median of a sequence that contains an even number of items, we’ll take the average of the two innermost numbers, which will give us our median.

(9 + 12) / 2 = 10.5

Bonus tip: The GRE may complicate things a bit by giving you a set of numbers that are not listed in numerical order. Be sure to rearrange them first before calculating the median.

3. Mode

Finding the mode of a set requires you to identify the number that occurs most frequently. While this seems fairly straightforward, there is an important caveat to remember. Consider the set below.

2, 2, 4, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9

If your first question about this set is how to determine whether 5 or 9 is the mode, you’re on the right track. In fact, both are the right answer in this case. Unlike what we’ve learned about the mean and median, there can be more than one mode in a set of numbers. In the event that each number only appears once, we can either say that each number is the mode, or that there is no mode in the set at all.

4. Standard deviation

Here’s where things get a little trickier on the GRE. The point of standard deviation is to quantify the standard or average amount by which each piece of data deviates from the average data value in a set. Consider the two data sets below:

Group A: 12, 19, 27, 35, 52

Group B: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16

In some instances, the GRE will ask you to simply identify which group has the larger standard deviation. Just by looking at these two sets, you can see that the numbers in Group A are far more spread out, meaning that its standard deviation is higher as well. However, be prepared to find the exact standard deviation of a set (or sets) of numbers. The steps to finding the standard deviation of a set include:

Finding the mean of the entire set of numbers

Finding the differences between the mean of the set and each individual number

Squaring each of those differences

Finding the average of the new squared values

Find the square root of the new squared values

To illustrate this, let’s apply these steps to Group B (2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16)

Find the mean: (2+4+6+8+12+16) / 6 = 8

Find the differences between the mean and each individual number: -6, -4, -2, 0, 4, 8

Find the squares of each difference: 36, 16, 4, 0, 16 and 64

Find the mean of these squares: (36+16+4+0+16+64) / 6 = 22.67

The square root of 22.67 (and our standard deviation) is 4.76

Note: the GRE won’t always ask you to provide the exact standard deviation of a set. Often, GRE questions will focus more on your overall understanding of the concept.","['number', 'numbers', '12', 'gre', 'set', 'mode', 'median', 'deviation', 'important', 'mean', 'standard', 'know', 'concepts', 'statistics']",2017-09-04 16:44:46+00:00

Spend now, pay later

In Britain the government’s budget provided yet more spending on workers and businesses to cushion the blow of the pandemic. The furlough scheme, which pays staff wages and has been in place for a year, was extended to September. Fiscal support for the pandemic now totals £407bn ($570bn). To pay for all this the government set out tax increases, including a rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25% in 2023. Before that there will be a two-year tax break for companies intended to spur investment. See article.

Covid-related restrictions brought about a 6% drop in energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions last year, according to the International Energy Agency. But as demand picked up, so did emissions, which were 2% higher in December 2020 than in December 2019. With its economy rebounding, China’s emissions rose over the year, by 0.8%; in America they fell by 10%. Globally, the decline in road activity accounted for 50% of the fall in demand for oil, and the slump in aviation for 35%.

45,['The Economist'],"B RITAIN HAD a particularly bad bout of covid-19 and took an especially large economic hit as a result. In response the government provided more fiscal stimulus than almost any other in the world, paying millions of people’s wages and bailing out businesses to the tune of 16% of GDP . As Britain slowly lifts its lockdown the conversation has turned to balancing the books, and ahead of the budget on March 3rd the Treasury briefed that fiscal austerity was in store. Yet Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, will wait to turn the screws. He delivered a surprisingly generous budget, and has postponed tax rises. Like a fiscal St Augustine, he wants continence—but not yet.

The budget represents the synthesis of two opposing forces. On the one hand Mr Sunak wants to placate a range of hawkish constituencies, such as Thatcherite backbench Tory MP s who would rather the government keep taxes low and bond traders who in recent weeks have sold their investments in sovereign debt. On the other hand he is rightly concerned not to repeat the mistake of his predecessor-but-two: after the financial crisis in 2007-09 George Osborne cut spending and raised taxes too soon, thereby delaying the recovery.

Policies in this budget are designed to help Britain out of its deep economic hole (see article). The extension of the furlough scheme from April to September will put money in people’s pockets, helping power a recovery in household spending. A highly unusual proposal to allow firms to write off 130% of investment expenses against their tax bills is designed to supercharge Britain’s perennially low rate of business investment.

At the same time, the budget has blind spots. Extending the furlough is better than nothing, but it would have been wiser to focus resources on boosting working-age welfare, currently at its least generous level ever. This would have helped workers move from dying sectors to up-and-coming ones without seeing a sharp drop in their take-home income. And a government that likes to trumpet its green credentials should not be buying off voters by freezing taxes on fuel. A bigger difficulty is that there is no credible strategy for righting the fiscal ship. True, Mr Sunak promised to raise corporation tax in 2023 from 19% to 25%. Politically that is astute. It puts the opposition Labour Party into a tricky position, forcing it to decide whether it wants to support the rise (and thus implicitly back austerity) or oppose it (and thus appear to be taking the side of Britain’s corporate fat cats). In economic terms, however, Mr Sunak is being evasive. The yield from even large rises in corporation tax is low. Moreover, will he actually impose such a tax rise just when the 130% investment write-off ends and when an election is likely to be just around the corner? It is more probable that the chancellor hopes the coming investment boom is so large that he can cancel most of the tax increase and that he will be able to pass a smaller rise as, in effect, a “cut”. At some point, however, politics will catch up with him. That is in part because of Britain’s rapidly ageing population, and in part because the government has bizarrely made no provision whatsoever for virus-related costs beyond next year. Britain is on an inexorable trend towards higher budget deficits. It is hard to find much waste in the public sector, which limits the scope to cut spending. The chancellor will have to fall back on higher taxes. He will have to consider slaying sacred Tory cows, including a pledge not to increase income tax. He should consider reform of property and value-added taxes. Hawkish rhetoric is all very well, but eventually Mr Sunak will have to follow St Augustine onto the path of fiscal virtue. ■

46,['The Economist'],"J OE BIDEN has made no secret of his frustration with Saudi Arabia. A “pariah” with “very little social redeeming value”, he called its government in 2019. One of his first acts as president was to end American support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Last week he released an intelligence report that blamed the kingdom’s crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, for the murder of a journalist in 2018. But at that point Mr Biden’s ideals collided with America’s national interest. The prince may be a brute, but he is also in charge of an important American ally. In the end Mr Biden decided that the cost of punishing him would have been too high.

This is all part of a larger cost-benefit analysis taking place in the White House. Mr Biden has signalled that he wants to make the Middle East less of a priority. He has good reason to pull back. America has thousands of soldiers spread across Arab countries, yet its interventions have produced dismal results. Many Americans argue that their country should instead focus on countering China’s growing global influence. The question facing the Biden administration is how to lighten America’s burden in the Middle East while still protecting its vital interests there. That will not be easy.

It helps that those interests are not what they were. For decades America focused on the flow of Gulf oil and the survival of Israel. Last year America was a net exporter of both oil and natural gas. And Israel, the best-armed country in the region, now has formal ties with many of its Arab neighbours.

Yet vital interests remain. Terrorist groups that find havens in Iraq, Syria or Yemen may end up striking the West. If the government in Iran seeks a bomb it risks setting off an arms race that would blow apart the global non-proliferation regime and permanently put the Middle East on a nuclear knife-edge.

In the past America has sought to impose magical solutions. George W. Bush attempted to decree a democracy in Iraq. Donald Trump wielded sanctions to force capitulation or a change in regime in Iran. As these approaches failed, American policy swung between interest and apathy, and war and retreat.

Mr Biden should instead try to bring stability by getting the region to take responsibility for itself and discouraging leaders from being so dependent on armed force. America’s big arms sales to the region’s despots are a source of trouble. And they do little to help the region’s people, who suffer from poor government and abusive regimes, which in turn foster extremism. RAND , a think-tank, recently noted that America spends roughly as much on Egypt’s armed forces as it does on aid to the entire region. Mr Biden should cancel the blank cheque for mischief-making and repression.

The second leg to this strategy is to enhance the Middle East’s capacity for diplomacy. The deals known as the Abraham Accords, which the Trump administration helped broker between Israel and several Arab states, are a tentative start towards upgrading the region’s diplomatic machinery. Mr Biden should encourage more such talking. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were shocked when Mr Trump failed to come to their defence after attacks by Iran and its proxies. Iran is suffering under American sanctions. Their anxiety gives Mr Biden leverage in asserting that lowering tensions is in everyone’s interest.

Encouraging diplomacy does not mean withdrawing all American troops. They have helped suppress Islamic State and al-Qaeda, which are still active. And soft power tends to be more effective when hard power lurks in the background. For example, the air strike on an Iranian-backed militia in Syria last month was retaliation for an attack on Americans in Iraq—and a signal to the government in Tehran that Mr Biden would not roll over in negotiations to revive the Iran nuclear deal. Talking is not easy but, if America wants to focus less on a troubled part of the world, it is the only way ahead. ■","['american', 'regions', 'region', 'east', 'joe', 'mr', 'trump', 'middle', 'biden', 'america', 'nest', 'hornets', 'iran', 'arab']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
47,['The Economist'],"P URGES HAVE grown more common since Xi Jinping took over as China’s leader in 2012. To curb graft and snuff out any opposition to his rule, Mr Xi has been hunting in every corner of the country’s vast bureaucracy. Hundreds of thousands of officials have been punished. Thousands, many of them high-ranking, have been sent to prison. Remarkably, however, some people do not appear to have got the message. A new campaign has just been launched within the domestic security services (see article). Weeding out the disloyal is its primary goal.

Can there still be serious opposition to Mr Xi? There is certainly little sign of it on the streets. Many ordinary citizens express content with his rule. Under him, China has become far more influential globally. The economy has kept on growing at a healthy rate (and surprisingly well despite the pandemic). His anti-corruption efforts are popular. Neither is there any obvious sign of discontent within the Communist Party elite. It seems likely that many bitterly resent the anti-graft inspectors, and that some senior officials even gnash their teeth. But those with misgivings about Mr Xi know they must keep their mouths shut and their heads down.

A lesson from this latest purge, however, is that the outside world only dimly understands Mr Xi’s political world. One stated aim of the campaign is to remove the “pernicious influence” of Zhou Yongkang, who was China’s security overlord just before Mr Xi took power. Mr Zhou was jailed in 2015 for corruption and leaking state secrets. Officials also accused him of “political plotting”—shorthand, many observers believe, for scheming against Mr Xi. That his name is still being invoked years later hints at tensions, but it is hard for outsiders to judge how serious they are. The agencies being targeted in the new campaign occupy the darkest corners of an opaque political system: the police, the secret police, the judiciary and the prison service. In the months leading up to the purge several powerful figures within this apparatus were toppled. One was the chief of police in Shanghai, who has been accused of forming “factions”. All detail of what that may mean is a closely guarded secret.

Despite this, the new purge contains clear messages. One is Mr Xi’s appetite for power. The campaign will wrap up in time for a big political event late in 2022: the five-yearly party congress. He looks sure to use this to extend his rule for another five years, in defiance of the convention that general secretaries step down after a decade. Tightening control over the security forces will help crush any opposition to his innovation.

That raises the other, still bigger, reason to pay attention. For all the seeming relentlessness of the rise of China under an increasingly adamantine authoritarianism, politics can pack surprises that suddenly change the country’s trajectory. Consider the arrest of Mao Zedong’s widow and others in the “Gang of Four” in 1976, the struggle that brought Deng Xiaoping to power two years later, the regime-threatening splits within the party that emerged during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the political bloodletting that eliminated Mr Xi’s rivals in the lead-up to his own anointment. You cannot rule out more such disruptive shocks.

In the build-up to next year’s congress, the murky waters of Chinese politics will deserve even closer scrutiny. That is in part because Mr Xi defies norms. As well as rejecting the modern principle that China’s leader gets only ten years at the top, he has seized more levers of power than any ruler since Mao. It is also because, under Mr Xi, the regime has become even more secretive. Alas, such secrecy makes for a government less accountable to citizens and more likely to catch the world unaware. ■","['rule', 'chinas', 'security', 'political', 'corners', 'xi', 'sense', 'mr', 'xis', 'making', 'services', 'darkest', 'campaign', 'purge', 'power', 'world']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
48,['The Economist'],"I T HAS BEEN ten years since a tsunami laid waste the Pacific coast of northern Honshu, Japan’s most populous island. The tsunami and the undersea earthquake which triggered it, the largest ever recorded in the region, killed nearly 20,000 people, destroyed over 100,000 homes and threw the lives of tens of millions into turmoil. The direct economic cost, estimated at over $200bn, was larger than that of any other natural disaster the world has seen. And yet for many around the world the event is remembered for just one thing: the ensuing crisis at the Fuku-shima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant (see article).

The earthquake cut the plant off from outside sources of electricity. The tsunami easily topped the plant’s sea walls, flooding the underground bunkers containing its emergency generators—a foreseeable risk Japan’s neutered regulators had failed to foresee. Because there was no way to cool the reactor cores, the nuclear fuel within them began to melt; amid fire, explosion and alarming amounts of radiation, a puddle from hell began eating into the plant’s concrete foundations.

The world looked on aghast. In Shanghai and San Francisco iodine tablets and iodised salt jumped off the shelves as people looked for prophylaxis of which they had no need. In Germany the chancellor, Angela Merkel, who had long stood with business leaders against the country’s powerful anti-nuclear movement, ordered its reactors phased out. In China the world’s largest new nuclear-plant programme was put on hold. Talk of a “nuclear renaissance” to fight climate change fell silent.

The reaction, though understandable, was wrong. Nuclear power has a lot of drawbacks. Its large, slowly built plants are expensive both in absolute terms and in terms of the electricity they produce. Its very small but real risk of catastrophic failure requires a high level of regulation, and it has a disturbing history of regulatory capture, amply demonstrated in Japan. It produces extremely long-lived and toxic waste. And it is associated with the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Most of the countries outside Europe that use nuclear power have some history of attempting to develop a bomb. All these factors contribute to an unease with the technology felt, to greater or lesser extent, by people all around the world.

Against all that, though, two things must be remembered. One is that well-regulated nuclear power is safe. With the terrible Soviet-era exception of Chernobyl, nuclear disasters come without large death tolls. It was the tsunami, not radiation, that claimed nearly all those lives in Fukushima. The other is that the climate is in crisis, and nuclear plants can supply some of the vast amounts of emissions-free electricity the world needs if it is to cope. Solar and wind power are now much cheaper, but they are intermittent. Providing a reliable grid is a lot easier if some of its generating capacity can be assumed to be available all the time. Nuclear provides such capacity with no ongoing emissions, and it is doing so safely and at scale around the world.

Despite this, safe and productive nuclear plants are being closed across the rich world. Those closures and the retirement of older sites mean that advanced economies could lose two-thirds of their nuclear capacity by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. If new fossil-fuel infrastructure fills the gap, it will last for decades. If renewables do so, the opportunity cost will be measured in gigatonnes of carbon. Renewables replacing nuclear capacity would almost always be better deployed to replace fossil-fuel capacity.

Sometimes the closure of nuclear plants is largely a matter of economics. In places where emitting carbon dioxide comes with no price, such as America, the benefits of being emissions-free are hidden from the market. That hurts nuclear, and it should be rectified. When closure is political, the onus is on Green politicians, in particular, to change their tune. To hasten the decline of nuclear power is wilfully to hobble the world in the greatest environmental struggle of all.

The argument for keeping existing nuclear plants open has been strengthened, in some places, by one of the responses to Fukushima: greater independence for nuclear regulators. Britain granted new freedom to its regulator after 2011. So did Japan. Though grander hopes for reform after the tsunami bore little fruit, Japan did largely take the regulators’ hand from the power companies’ glove. Its new supervisor has made reopening mothballed nuclear power plants harder than the government would like, but that is as it should be. In Japan more than anywhere, nuclear needs to earn back trust to be useful.

This points to nuclear’s greatest weakness. In democracies it is expensive, owing to regulation and public antipathy, which makes new nuclear power a hard sell. The technology is thus increasingly the preserve of autocracies—precisely the systems where good regulation is least likely. Having paused after Fukushima, China’s nuclear plans accelerated as part of an effort to reduce reliance on coal. China produced four times as much nuclear energy in 2019 as it did in 2011; it has 16 reactors under construction and another 39 planned. Countries wanting new nuclear plants now look to China and Russia as suppliers.

There is a strong case for democracies seeking to replace ageing nuclear plants with non-intermittent equivalents to join the importers. If Chinese reactors are designed in the knowledge that they will have to meet with the approval of independent regulators the world will be a safer place. At the same time, in boosting energy R&D to tackle the climate crisis, Western governments should be sure to give nuclear its fair share. There are real attractions to some new approaches, notably smaller reactors with lower unit costs: in platoons they can replace old plants; singly they can add incremental capacity where needed. They might perhaps be used to retrofit old fossil-fuel plants.

It’s critical

Nuclear power has drawbacks the size of a tsunami. But with Chinese plants being built today that will not be decommissioned until the 22nd century, it cannot simply be wished away. What is more, it has a vital role to play in the fight for a stable climate. The lesson of Fukushima is not to eschew nuclear power, it is to use it wisely. ■

Alternative energies

As your briefing on decarbonising America noted, New Mexico’s economy depends on robust oil-and-gas production in the Permian basin that was revitalised by fracking a decade ago (“The switch”, February 20th). New Mexicans, however, have been interested in innovation and energy diversification for quite a lot longer than the article implied. America’s only uranium-enrichment facility is in the state. It is one of the largest private-capital investments ever made in New Mexico, producing around a third of the nuclear fuel required to power the 94 nuclear reactors that generate a fifth of America’s electricity and 55% of its carbon-free electricity.

So although New Mexico may indeed be producing 1% of America’s greenhouse-gas emissions, it is also producing the fuel which generates carbon-free electricity. The technology used to process uranium is modular and can be expanded economically to meet the growing need for nuclear power that Bill Gates has recently called for.

You did not mention efficiency. Greater end-use efficiency reduces the investment in renewables required to reach ambitious climate targets, and improves grid resiliency when generation or transmission infrastructure may otherwise be stressed. It is a huge challenge to decarbonise America’s energy sector; we’ll need all the solutions available to do it.

Charlemagne was right to say that Russia should be handled more firmly and decisively by the European Union (February 13th). Helmut Schmidt, Germany’s chancellor from 1974 to 1982, summarised it best when he said that Russia is basically Upper Volta with rockets (now Burkina Faso). Unfortunately Russia has no systematic plans to develop its natural-resource capabilities or better the lot of its citizens, quite unlike China. And it is run by cronies.

Constitutional order

There is an interesting story behind the First Amendment of the American constitution, which Donald Trump’s defence made much of during his impeachment trial (“Marred but at largio”, February 20th). The First Amendment protecting free speech, among other rights, is a combination of what was originally intended to be the third and fourth of 19 amendments that James Madison introduced in June 1789 as the Bill of Rights. They were combined into a Third Amendment, and became the First only after the two that came before it failed to get enough support in the states for ratification.

Madison gave numerical priority to the anti-establishment and exercise of religion clauses, and originally put freedoms of speech, press and assembly into a separate subsequent amendment. Mr Trump’s team expounded free speech as not being an “accident”, that it is the “very first liberty in the first article of the Bill of Rights…the most important one”. Actually, it is first because of exactly that, an accident of history.

Expanding diversity

It is difficult to share Bagehot’s giddy excitement about diversity within the Conservative Party (January 30th). The black and brown faces in the cabinet share, for the most part, the same social, educational and professional backgrounds as their white colleagues. Although this is progress, it is picking at the low-hanging fruit of diversity. As a black Briton I think that many of the black Tories mentioned in the article hold views that differ from the minority communities we are told they represent. Indeed, many have been missing in action on issues that resonate with black Britons, such as policing and criminal justice, the Windrush scandal, Black Lives Matter and covid-19. Perhaps having more black and brown people in government gives comfort to Conservatives, but they are neither a source of excitement nor inspiration for the black community.

If you want “diversity” you need a more meaningful representation of minority peoples.

Who watches the sunset?

You asked how should economists think about biodiversity (Free exchange, February 6th)? One policy that I struggled with while working at Britain’s Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ( DEFRA ) was placing a value on those areas where the exact economic benefits to humans is difficult to quantify. What, for example, is the economic value to humans of the view of an unsullied beach at sunset, or of the continued existence of pandas, or of the re-introduction of beavers or wolves in areas where they are extinct? The value of a sunset can, to some extent, be estimated from house-price differentials, but we struggle with the other examples; if we cannot put a numerical value on something, it often gets overlooked.

The British government’s report on the economics of biodiversity, produced by Partha Dasgupta, is a vital step towards making the case for environmental protection in the most effective way possible. But we must be careful not to focus on those areas that we can easily quantify at the expense of those that we cannot.

50,['The Economist'],"F OR MOST of its history, the European Union commanded no troops. It was not that sort of outfit. The idea of gun-toting Euro-soldiers was more a Eurosceptic bogeyman than a serious scheme. Yet on January 11th the bloc tweeted proudly that “[f]or the first time, the European Union has its own uniformed service”. A video, set to rousing music, showed a blue-clad, side-capped guard with the insignia not of any member state, but of the star-circled flag of Europe—a member of the new standing corps of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, more commonly known as Frontex. But if the agency’s rise exemplifies the union’s march towards something resembling a state, it also illustrates how unsteady, and occasionally ugly, that advance may be.

When the idea of a joint border force was first mooted around the turn of the millennium, EU member states balked at the idea. Many had just abolished their national currencies and adopted the euro; pooling yet more sovereignty in a highly sensitive area was a step too far. Frontex eventually came into being in 2004, with a tiny budget and meagre staff, after a surge of irregular migration into the Canary Islands. But it was the migration crisis of 2015 that would transform its fortunes.

Politicians, desperate to shore up their borders, shovelled money and power at Frontex. Its budget leapt from under €100m ($123m) in 2014 to €280m by 2017, reaching almost €400m last year. Under the EU ’s budget for 2022-29, Frontex is due to get €5.6bn for the seven-year period—half of what it originally hoped for, but a tidy sum nonetheless. The agency has also been given the right to recruit personnel and buy equipment directly, rather than borrowing both from member states. Its standing corps is on track to grow to 6,500 staff this year, with the aim of reaching 10,000 by 2027.

Its existing guards have already fanned out across Europe’s land and sea borders, where their job is largely to reinforce and support national border forces. But they have also ventured farther afield. Frontex personnel have deployed to “pre-frontier” areas such as Albania and Montenegro, and civilian officials to Niger, Turkey, Senegal and Serbia, where they monitor migrant flows headed towards Europe. Those without uniforms need not worry about missing out. As well as patrolling borders, Frontex is now responsible for running a new European Travel Information and Authorisation System ( ETIAS ), which will screen and authorise non- EU citizens entering the borderless Schengen zone without a visa, including Britons. Around 250 staff in Warsaw will eventually run the system around the clock. It also runs the European Border Surveillance System ( EUROSUR ), which fuses data from drones, ships, social media and the EU ’s Copernicus Earth-observation satellites to build up a picture of migrant flows. As its coffers have grown, Frontex has set its eyes on fancier kit. Last year the agency signed contracts with Airbus and Israeli Aerospace Industries, and Elbit, another Israeli firm, to buy €100m-worth of advanced drones to be based in Greece, Italy and Malta. It is also pouring money into other technology, including artificial intelligence. “I think the European Commission sees that as a way of muscling into the sort of core defence sphere, like dual-use and border technologies,” says Roderick Parkes of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “They've really got Europol in their sights,” he adds, referring to the EU ’s law-enforcement agency. But whereas Europol is regarded as a pocket of administrative excellence, Frontex has a more chequered reputation. On December 7th the EU ’s anti-fraud office, OLAF , raided the offices of Fabrice Leggeri, Frontex’s director, and his chef de cabinet as part of a probe into misconduct, including the “pushback” (illegal deportation) of migrants. In October an investigation by Bellingcat, a digital-forensics group, and several news outlets said that Frontex vessels were either “actively involved” or present during several such efforts on the Greek-Turkish border (Frontex denies this). On January 27th Frontex said it had suspended operations in Hungary, after the EU ’s top court criticised that country’s forcible return of migrants to Serbia.

Many of these problems are “growing pains”, says Hanne Beirens of the Migration Policy Institute Europe, a think-tank. One issue is that Frontex’s central administration is too small to supervise the growing number of far-flung staff and their compliance with human-rights rules. In the past, member states were partly responsible for their officers on secondment with Frontex. The new standing corps severs this national chain of accountability, says Raphael Bossong of SWP, a think-tank in Berlin. “Ultimately, the EU would directly become responsible for these executive actions, including those with potentially lethal consequences.”

Yet more management would not solve the problem. The larger issue, says Ms Beirens, is the clash between the EU ’s spiralling ambitions—it has expanded Frontex’s mandate thrice in the space of five years—and the agency’s limited powers on the ground. If officials see abuse occurring, they have few options to stop it other than to pull out, as in Hungary. In some cases, local border forces conduct the most unsavoury activity when Frontex is not looking.

Other problems will need ironing out too. As Frontex expands, it risks drawing recruits away from the EU ’s existing pool of 100,000 or so border guards, leaving gaps in national forces. And the pattern of recruitment might also show up deeper faultlines. Frontex’s foot soldiers are drawn from low-wage eastern and southern European countries, but its leadership comes from wealthier north-western ones “who haven’t guarded a land border in the last 30 years”, observes Mr Parkes.","['wild', 'eu', 'staff', 'european', 'frontier', 'size', 'swells', 'eus', 'border', 'frontex', 's', 'frontexs', 'member', 'including', 'force', 'kings', 'national']",2021-03-03 00:00:00
51,['The Economist'],"F OR MUCH of France’s Fifth Republic, the modern state established by Charles de Gaulle in 1958, criminal cases against elected politicians have often failed either to reach court or to end in a conviction, let alone a prison sentence. On March 1st a Paris court took a step closer to ending an era of impunity. It found Nicolas Sarkozy, a centre-right president from 2007 to 2012, guilty of corruption and influence-peddling. He was sentenced to three years in prison, two of them suspended.

The decision has sent a shockwave through the French political class. This is the first time an ex-president has been handed an irreducible prison sentence. In 2011 Jacques Chirac, another centre-right former president, was handed a two-year suspended sentence for the misuse of public funds, dating to his time as mayor of Paris in the 1990s. Mr Sarkozy has denied all the allegations, and has appealed.

The case against him dates back to 2013. Investigators tapped his mobile phone while looking into allegations that Muammar Qaddafi, the former Libyan leader, had helped finance the French candidate’s campaign in 2007. They stumbled upon conversations between Mr Sarkozy and Thierry Herzog, then his lawyer. These exchanges, which the pair thought were protected by lawyer-client privilege, concerned separate illegal party-financing allegations then circulating. The case against Mr Sarkozy in that affair had been dropped. But, prosecutors said, he wanted information linked to other inquiries.

During these conversations, ruled the court this week, a “corruption pact” emerged. In return for information, Mr Sarkozy offered to help secure for Gilbert Azibert, an appeals-court magistrate, a plum job in Monaco. (Mr Azibert never got the job.) The court also gave Mr Herzog and Mr Azibert prison sentences of three years each, two of them suspended. Both deny the accusations. Mr Sarkozy, the judge said, who was “the guarantor of the independence of the judiciary, used his status as former president to reward a magistrate for having served his personal interest.”

Mr Sarkozy is unlikely to end up behind bars. The court said he could wear an electronic tag instead. He has in any case appealed, a process that could take many months, if not years. Christian Jacob, head of his Republicans party, called the sentencing “absolutely disproportionate”. Mr Sarkozy called it a “profound injustice”, and stressed that no money changed hands: even the judge said the ruling was based on a “faisceau d’indices” (a body of indications), not proof. Friends say that magistrates were out to bring the ex-president down. On March 17th Mr Sarkozy is due in court to face separate charges of exceeding campaign-finance caps. He denies these accusations too.

In recent years, courts have convicted a string of French politicians. This has begun to erode the sense that they are untouchable. Last year a court sentenced François Fillon, Mr Sarkozy’s former prime minister and a presidential candidate, to five years in prison, three of them suspended, for embezzlement. He is awaiting his appeal. Others include Jérôme Cahuzac, a Socialist ex-budget minister, Claude Guéant, Mr Sarkozy’s former chief of staff, and Patrick Balkany, an ex-deputy from Mr Sarkozy’s party and former mayor of Levallois-Perret, a Paris suburb.

In one of those twists at which the French excel, the once-hyperkinetic Mr Sarkozy has become more popular since he left office than when he was president. Despite the judicial tangles, time and defeat at the ballot box in 2012 appear to have softened opinion towards Mr Sarkozy. A recent poll, taken before the verdict, found him to be France’s sixth-most-popular politician. He continues informally to oversee matters relating to the Republicans, ahead of the presidential election in 2022. Some of those close to him suggest that, before this week, he had not given up hopes of running again.","['frances', 'nicolas', 'class', 'sentence', 'shocks', 'political', 'sarkozy', 'president', 'french', 'court', 'impunity', 'end', 'mr', 'suspended', 'jail', 'paris', 'sarkozys', 'prison']",2021-03-01 00:00:00
52,['The Economist'],"T O SOME HE was a military genius, strategic mastermind and visionary leader who bequeathed to France a centralised modern administration and sense of gloire. To others he was a tyrant and a butcher who squandered French supremacy in Europe on the battlefield of Waterloo. Napoleon Bonaparte, who died in captivity on the British island of Saint Helena at the age of 51, has long inspired both admiration and distaste, even in France. Now, ahead of the bicentenary of his death on May 5th 1821, those rival passions have been revived.

Alexis Corbière, a deputy from Unsubmissive France, a left-wing party, declared: “It is not for the republic to celebrate its gravedigger.” On the right Jean-Louis Debré, formerly head of the constitutional council, said that “overdoing it” would be “a provocation”. The Black Lives Matter movement has emboldened those who reject any celebration of a leader who reintroduced slavery to the French West Indies in 1802. Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol, the Socialist mayor of Rouen, says he wants to replace the imposing bronze statue of the emperor on horseback that stands outside his Normandy town hall.

Yet the French also acknowledge that they owe much of their modern state, and its institutions, not to mention their country’s aspiration to grandeur, to the “little Corsican”. As first consul, Napoleon created the French legal code, the Bank of France, the administrative system of préfets, high-school lycées, the légion d’honneur and much more. In a poll in 2016 he was listed as the second-most-important Frenchman in history, after Charles de Gaulle. His red quartzite tomb in Les Invalides, lying in splendid isolation in a crypt beneath the dome, receives over a million visitors a year. This spring scores of new books are promised, says the Fondation Napoléon, as well as conferences and a big exhibition in Paris. “We have every reason to be proud of him,” said Patrice Gueniffey, a historian, who considers him a historical figure on a par with Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar (both of whom also killed a lot of people).

President Emmanuel Macron has not yet shown his hand. In 2005 Jacques Chirac, a Gaullist predecessor at the Elysée Palace, refused—amid protests at the time—to commemorate the bicentenary of Napoleon’s victory at Austerlitz. Talk shows have been debating what to do this year, and whether his legacy is damaging or beneficial for France. An adept of “en même temps”, or the improbable art of reconciling opposing views, Mr Macron has his work cut out.","['waterloo', 'despot', 'french', 'emperors', 'macron', 'work', 'genius', 'west', 'argues', 'napoleon', 'leader', 'bicentenary', 'modern', 'france', 'clothes']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
53,['The Economist'],"F OR A MAN in his own army’s cross-hairs, Nikol Pashinyan, the Armenian prime minister, seems unfazed. As long as the Armenian people have the final say, “there will be no coup,” he told The Economist this week. The only way out of the crisis consuming his country, he says, leads through the ballot box and early elections.

There are no tanks on the street in Yerevan. But Mr Pashinyan is fighting for his political life. On February 25th dozens of officers, including the country’s top soldier, Onik Gasparyan, demanded the prime minister’s resignation, accusing him of incompetence. Mr Pashinyan called this an attempted coup, refused to step down and ordered Mr Gasparyan to do so instead. (So far, he has not.)

Tensions in Armenia have been brewing since November, when Mr Pashinyan signed an armistice with Azerbaijan, ending a war over Nagorno-Karabakh, a separatist ethnic-Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan. More than 6,000 people died in the fighting. Armenian defences were pummelled by Turkish drones and overrun by Azerbaijani ground forces. Under the ceasefire agreement, Armenia gave up control of swathes of land which it had captured around Karabakh three decades earlier. The enclave’s status remains unresolved. Some 2,000 Russian troops have been deployed there to keep the peace.

To many Armenians, persuaded by the army and the government that the fighting was going their way, the surrender came as a shock and a betrayal. Mr Pashinyan immediately came under fire. The opposition blamed him for provoking the war and losing the peace. Protesters stormed government buildings. The army (and the Kremlin) bristled after Mr Pashinyan claimed that Russia’s Iskander missiles, which Armenia used at least once during the war, had turned out to be duds. He backtracked after a phone call with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin.

The protests have attracted no more than a few thousand people. But those who turn up seem to be spoiling for a fight. “Pashinyan sold out my homeland and my people,” says Hrachya Abramyan, a veteran of both Karabakh wars, at a rally in front of the parliament. “If he does not resign, we will grab him by the ears and throw him out like a dog.” The opposition parties have not warmed to an offer of snap elections, presumably because they continue to trail in the polls. Instead they propose a transitional government. Some appear on the verge of endorsing an actual coup. “I don’t like the idea,” says Davit Harutyunyan, a former minister. “But if I feel that without taking the next step we risk losing the country and civil war, then definitely.”

Mr Pashinyan, a former journalist, came to power in 2018, when exasperation with decades of cronyism overflowed into mass protests, bringing down the government of Serzh Sargsyan, his predecessor. Yet the tide that propelled Mr Pashinyan into power has ebbed. In elections two years ago, he won 70% of the vote. Today only 39% of Armenians want him in charge. He had already faced criticism for his handling of the economy and the covid-19 crisis. He has made no new friends by shrugging off the blame for the lost war.

Many see a Russian hand in the army’s move against Mr Pashinyan. Yet Russia may not want the Armenian leader gone, so much as tamed. Mr Pashinyan was once eager to loosen Armenia from Russia’s grip and to improve relations with Western powers. That is no longer possible. Hobbling from a lost war, squeezed between two old enemies and frustrated by Western inaction, Armenia now depends on Russia’s security guarantees more than ever, no matter who is in charge. ■","['war', 'coup', 'came', 'western', 'armenia', 'fighting', 'armenias', 'army', 'mr', 'russias', 'minister', 'pashinyan', 'turns', 'armenian', 'prime']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
54,['The Economist'],"O N MARCH 1ST Russian news announced that Alexei Navalny was moving to a new prison, Penal Colony No. 2, notorious for psychological torture. Two days later his lawyers found him in a different, and less ghastly, jail. Russia’s justice system likes to keep people guessing.

The Kremlin says Mr Navalny, Russia’s main opposition leader, is a common criminal, as well as being a Western agent. Its propagandists tout his (plainly bogus) fraud conviction. Their struggle to convict him in the court of public opinion has received a boost from an unlikely source: Amnesty International, a global human-rights group.

On February 23rd Amnesty said it had decided to stop calling Mr Navalny a “prisoner of conscience”, a term first popularised by Amnesty itself. The reason given was that he had made some xenophobic comments nearly 15 years ago. Amnesty had not planned to publicise this decision, but an internal memo had leaked.

Kremlin megaphones went wild. Day after day they quoted Amnesty’s verdict that Mr Navalny’s comments constituted “advocacy of hatred”. “I very much understand Amnesty International which talks about hatred from Navalny’s side,” crowed Dmitry Kiselev, Mr Putin’s operatic propagandist-in-chief. The head of RT , a state broadcaster, called Mr Navalny a Nazi.

This propaganda coup was made easier by a shift in philosophy at Amnesty. In 1961 Peter Benenson, the group’s founder, defined a “prisoner of conscience” as anyone who is locked up for expressing an opinion “which does not advocate or condone personal violence”. For decades, this definition worked well. Amnesty’s campaigns helped bring about the release of legions of dissidents, including many in the old Soviet Union. But a new generation of activists decided that it was not enough to eschew violence. Since 1995, to merit the label “prisoner of conscience”, a dissident must also not have used hateful language.

Two videos Mr Navalny made, in 2007 and 2011, failed that test. At the time he was trying to build a broad coalition of liberals and nationalists to oppose Mr Putin. To this end, he sought to persuade patriotic voters not to back violent ultra-nationalists, who were then on the rise. In one video he condemned physical attacks on illegal immigrants, and said Russia should deport them instead. In another, he referred to Islamist militants as “cockroaches”.

Mr Navalny has long ago publicly expressed regret for using disparaging language about other ethnic groups, but has not specifically disavowed the videos. His activism now consists largely of pointing out how corrupt the Putin regime is. This rattles the Kremlin, which is why it tried to assassinate him last year. It is also why its propagandists worked so hard, after Amnesty named Mr Navalny a prisoner of conscience in January, to persuade the group that he isn’t.

Amnesty was flooded by almost identical complaints about Mr Navalny from “concerned citizens”. Many cited a Twitter thread by Katya Kazbek, a freelancer for RT , highlighting the old videos and calling Mr Navalny “an avowed racist”. The complainants urged Amnesty to abide by its own rules and strike Mr Navalny off its list of prisoners of conscience.

It did—and, by doing so, raised questions about those rules. The old definition of a prisoner of conscience was clear: a dissident who neither commits nor advocates violence. The new one is fuzzy. What counts as “hate speech” changes rapidly, and varies from place to place and listener to listener. If Amnesty disqualifies anyone who has ever said anything that is currently deemed hateful, it hands despots a powerful tool. Dig up the worst thing a dissident has ever said, and watch a Western human-rights group tie itself in knots.

Amnesty says it still considers Mr Navalny a political prisoner, even if he is not a prisoner of conscience, and calls for his release. The distinction is lost on many. Boris Akunin, a novelist, wrote to Amnesty: “Instead of protecting a man who was first almost killed and then unjustly imprisoned by a dictatorship you struck him a further blow. You closed the doors of his cell even tighter, making it harder for us all to fight for the man’s freedom. By adhering to the letter of your protocol you failed the spirit of your mission.” ■","['prisoner', 'amnesty', 'conscience', 'dissident', 'confusion', 'mr', 'videos', 'international', 'old', 'violence', 'worked', 'navalny', 'outwitted', 'kremlin']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
55,['The Economist'],"W INFRIED KRETSCHMANN has a strong claim to be the world’s most powerful Green politician. True, Greens occupy a few junior ministries in places such as Austria and New Zealand. But Mr Kretschmann is the undisputed ruler of the state of Baden-Württemberg, an industrial powerhouse in Germany’s south-west that, with 11m people, is bigger than most EU countries. Ten years ago, voters spooked by the Fukushima nuclear accident and sick of decades of rule under the conservative Christian Democrats ( CDU ) doubled the Greens’ vote, elevating them to power at the head of a left-wing coalition. Even Mr Kretschmann was surprised. Yet he handily secured re-election in 2016, and may well repeat the feat at Baden-Württemberg’s election on March 14th. How he pulled it off carries lessons for the rest of the country, and perhaps beyond.

After a brief flirtation with revolutionary communism at university, by 1980 Mr Kretschmann had found his voice on the moderate “Realo” wing of the newly formed German Green Party. For years he nourished a small but growing audience for his message, articulated in the state legislature, that sustainability and other green topics ought to be combined with innovation and wealth creation. This put him “way ahead of his time”, says Danyal Bayaz, a Green MP from Baden-Württemberg.

Pro-business centrism is one of two pillars of Mr Kretschmann’s appeal today. Happy to label himself a “conservative”, he emphasises that climate protection must go hand in hand with economic growth, and readily slaps down bad ideas emanating from his own side. “People like it,” says Boris Palmer, the Green mayor of Tübingen, a town in Baden-Württemberg. “They don’t want party soldiers, they like politicians interested in their needs.” This has helped the Greens expand beyond their comfort zone, in cities such as Stuttgart and Freiburg, to former CDU voters and Mittelstand exporters, often in far-flung rural areas.

The second pillar is a well-crafted image that combines Mr Kretschmann’s down-home style—a devoted churchgoer and nature-lover who speaks in a hokey Swabian accent—with that of the philosopher-king who peppers interviews with Hannah Arendt quotes and lets it be known he spends his summers on Aegean islands thumbing through “The Iliad”. His big-tent Politik des Gehörtwerdens, the “politics of being heard”, is an antidote to divisive radicalism. Colleagues describe a patient leader open to fresh ideas on everything from school reform to artificial intelligence. All this gives Mr Kretschmann a statesmanlike aura that politicians from the CDU , now serving as the Greens’ junior coalition partner in the state, concede is damnably hard to run against.

It is a potent combination. Mr Kretschmann has at times led national popularity polls, despite having no ambitions beyond his home state (“Whenever I’m in Berlin, I am always reminded how beautiful it is in Baden-Württemberg,” he once quipped). Two-thirds of CDU voters in the state say they would vote for him directly given the chance. His popularity has inspired a mild personality cult. In a personalised campaign where the pandemic makes traditional electioneering impossible, voters are left to gaze at posters of their 72-year-old leader’s kindly visage overlaid with slogans such as: “He thinks about the big picture.”

Yet what do the Greens have to show for a decade in power? Mr Kretschmann’s government with the CDU can boast a strong biodiversity law, and an expansion of renewable power as the atomic sort disappears. Yet “given the constraints of the coalition, you won’t find so many concrete achievements,” says Mr Palmer. Take the car sector, which provides around one in five jobs. Not far from the grand Villa Reitzenstein in Stuttgart in which Mr Kretschmann conducts state business lie museums devoted to Mercedes and Porsche cars, and a square called Daimlerplatz. Mr Kretschmann once said he looked forward to a time with fewer cars on Germany’s roads. But he was condemned to hug the industry close.

Too close, for some. Mr Kretschmann’s commitment to yanking his state’s sometimes-dozy carmakers into the 21st century is genuine. Fearing that Baden-Württemberg could face a fate like Detroit’s, he has chivvied carmakers to confront challenges, such as the switch to electric cars, via a seven-year “strategic dialogue” started in 2017. But results are thin. In 2020 Mr Kretschmann disappointed many by teaming up with premiers of other petrolhead states to lobby for subsidies for diesel-fuelled cars. Some young activists fed up with Mr Kretschmann’s caution have formed a “Climate List” to contest the election. “The Greens have forgotten their roots,” grumbles Daniel Wagner, one of its candidates.

Over the years Mr Kretschmann has clashed with his party on everything from phasing out combustion engines to deporting failed asylum-seekers. For left-leaning Greens in other states, the party’s success in Baden-Württemberg can seem a mixed blessing: why seek office only to ape the conservatives? Mr Kretschmann replies that power is useless if you leave half of society behind. And as the only Green in charge of a state, he carries outsized weight in Germany’s federal system. His tendency to present himself as the voice of the party in national debates irritates colleagues elsewhere. But it has also made a difference, notably in 2019 when Greens in Germany’s upper house, where state representatives sit, sharpened a woefully unambitious climate-change package.

Don’t scare the horses

For all the hand-wringing, Mr Kretschmann’s centrism has carried the day in the national party, now firmly in the hands of Realos and gearing up to enter government after a general election in September. The habit of governing has become ingrained for the Greens, who sit in coalition in 11 of Germany’s 16 states. Should they agree to serve as junior partner to the CDU at national level, as polls suggest is likely, they will have to accept painful compromises. Yet if power is no longer the dirty word it once was in some Green circles, the party has its Swabian champion to thank. ■

56,['The Economist'],"R ARELY HAS supposedly bitter medicine tasted so sweet. For weeks, the Treasury has been briefing journalists that Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, was set to “level with the people” and embark on a programme of tax rises to repair the public finances. This, it turned out, was expectations management: the budget, delivered on March 3rd, was loaded with sugar. The nastier stuff has been pushed back by at least two years.

The explanation lay in the forecasts which the Office for Budget Responsibility ( OBR ), the government’s fiscal watchdog, publishes with the budget. A lot has changed since it released its previous set in November. A spike in covid-19 cases in December and January prompted a stringent third lockdown, which depressed expected growth further in 2021. Lower growth this year means an even larger bounce-back in 2022. The OBR now reckons that the economy will grow by 4% in 2021, down from 5.5% in the previous forecast, but then motor forward by 7.3% in 2022, the fastest rise in eight decades.

This year’s difficult start means that government schemes to keep people solvent are being extended. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, under which the government pays 80% of the wages of furloughed employees, was due to end in April. It will now stay until September. Grants and cheap loans to firms have been rolled forward too, as have lower levels of value-added tax for hospitality businesses. Spending has been increased by almost £35bn ($49bn) and taxes cut by £24bn in the coming financial year. Taken together, these measures represent a giveaway worth some 3% of GDP.

Every budget must contain a surprise for the chancellor to unveil. The uncertainty after the Brexit referendum in 2016, followed by the pandemic, has depressed business investment. So the centrepiece of Mr Sunak’s stimulus was the “super-deduction”, which will allow companies to set 130% of the value of new investment in plant and equipment against their taxable income for two years from April. The government is hoping that this generous tax-break will spur firms to use some of the record-high cash piles on which they are sitting to bring forward capital spending. An IMF study of such incentive schemes last year found that they tend to produce a strong response from firms by increasing the rate of return on investment.

With the economy buoyed by more fiscal support, the OBR thinks the output gap (the difference between the current level of GDP and its potential) will close more rapidly over the next couple of years than it previously believed. In other words, the cyclical recovery in the economy should proceed at a faster clip than expected.

A speedier cyclical pickup, though, will not eradicate the structural damage wrought by the pandemic. The OBR reckons that the economy will be 3% smaller in five years’ time than it would have been in a universe without a pandemic. That is bleaker than the Bank of England’s 1.75% estimate but broadly in line with Britain’s peers. The German budgetary authorities, for example, reckon their country will take a similar hit.

Lasting economic damage will have an impact on the public finances. Although Britain is currently operating without a formal set of fiscal rules, Mr Sunak has indicated that he wants to balance the current budget while borrowing for long-term investment. Given the blow to growth, achieving that aim means adopting some combination of spending cuts and tax rises once the immediate crisis has passed.

Mr Sunak has chosen to lean heavily on taxes, undoing the reductions in both personal and business tax that George Osborne introduced a decade ago. The tax take, as a share of the overall economy, is now forecast to rise to its highest level since the late 1960s (see chart).

Some of the extra revenue will come directly from workers. From 2023 income-tax thresholds will be frozen in cash terms, increasing the tax burden as incomes grow. But most of the cash will come from a striking rise in the headline rate of corporation tax, which is set to jump from 19% to 25% by 2023. According to the OBR , corporation-tax receipts will rise to their highest share of GDP since 1990 by 2024, though Mr Sunak was keen to emphasise that only around three in ten firms are likely to face the full increase. The small companies’ exemption will rise while firms will be able to carry forward up to three years of losses to reduce their bills. In effect, Mr Sunak is signalling a windfall tax on the companies that have done well during the pandemic, without calling it such.

Announcing the largest increases in corporation tax in a generation might have been expected to elicit more than a few groans from Britain’s boardrooms. Business trade bodies have, however, been quick to welcome the overall budget package. No doubt that is in part because of the large giveaways over the coming two years; but it is probably also because they suspect the tax rises will never fully materialise.

One reason to doubt that corporation tax will actually shoot up after 2023 is the cliff-edge that would create. The end of the super-deduction followed by an immediate and steep hike in headline rates would lead the effective rate, inclusive of allowances, to increase by more than five percentage points between 2023 and 2025 (see chart). That would be historically unusual. Mr Sunak will be hoping that as economic activity rebounds the OBR will revise down its view of the lasting hit from covid-19, and as the fiscal targets become easier to meet the mooted tax rises can then be scaled back. “It’s smart politics,” says a business leader. “If you say you are putting up tax by 6% and then only put it up by 3% everyone is grateful instead of horrified.”

Mr Sunak has announced a plan to balance the budget because that’s what Conservatives do. But it is far enough away that he has plenty of space for more giveaways in the future if the economy performs better than expected. ■","['rise', 'offers', 'obr', 'rises', 'economy', 'business', 'firms', 'british', 'set', 'mr', 'rishi', 'sunaks', 'budget', 'sunak', 'giveaways', 'tax', 'big']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
57,['The Economist'],"B EN HOUCHEN , the Tees Valley Mayor, is a persuasive man. For more than a year he lobbied the chancellor of the exchequer to create a low-tax “freeport” in his bailiwick and move lots of civil servants there. On the eve of Rishi Sunak’s budget speech he ratcheted up the rhetoric. “The question is,” he wrote in the Northern Echo, a local newspaper, “does Rishi have the strength to stand up to the Whitehall mandarins that have held our region back for so long?”

The answer is yes. On March 3rd Mr Sunak announced that many civil servants from business-oriented departments will move to a new campus in Darlington, west of Teesside. Mr Houchen will get his freeport—a zone where normal customs rules and tariffs are suspended. The mayor (a Conservative like the chancellor, who faces re-election in May) got everything he asked for. But what is good for Mr Houchen is less good for Britain.

Moving civil servants to an area tends to boost its economy. Giulia Faggio, an economist at City, University of London, estimates that a dispersal programme under the last Labour government created 11 private-sector jobs for every ten public-sector workers who arrived in an area. But the effect is localised. Private-sector employment swells in a small ring around the relocated civil servants and diminishes slightly a few miles away, as local businesses rush for the honeypot.

Darlington, which is already better-off than nearby towns and cities such as Hartlepool, Middlesbrough and Redcar, seems an odd place to favour. In 2018 its gross value-added per head (a measure of output) was 92% of the British average, compared with 72% for the north-east region as a whole. “It’s thriving already,” says Chris Hunter, the chief operating officer of Darlington Building Society. When not closed by covid, town-centre shops sell Farrow & Ball paint and expensive bicycles. Tess Wheeler, who used to work in the local steelworks, guesses that a middle-class Londoner posted to the town will find it “quaint”. It may owe its good fortune in part to its status as a Tory marginal; out of the 56 constituencies that will benefit from the first tranche of money from a “towns fund”, 47 are held by the Conservatives. The civil servants may not want to move. In 2003 the Meteorological Office managed to relocate 82% of its staff from Bracknell in the Thames Valley to Exeter. But a few years later only 10% of the Office for National Statistics’ London-based staff agreed to follow their employer to Newport in Wales. The difference was probably that the ONS ’s economists had plenty of other buyers for their skills, whereas the weather forecasters did not. Ominously for Darlington, Treasury staff look more like the first group. It is especially hard to winkle senior civil servants out of London. Two-thirds of them are based there, compared with only a fifth of the civil service overall. Philip Rycroft, who was permanent secretary of the Department for Exiting the EU until 2019, says they are glued to London because the politicians are there, and expect to be able to summon them quickly. Mr Sunak might occasionally work in Darlington—his constituency is nearby. But if the next chancellor is from Cornwall, the new campus will feel like a backwater. The Teesside freeport should fare better, although not for the advertised reasons. Imports to freeports are tariff-free, so components can be brought in and assembled into something else; tariffs are then paid when the finished goods are brought into the country. That is a big advantage in high-tariff countries, but in Britain tariffs are generally low. Julia Magntorn Garrett and Peter Holmes, economists at the University of Sussex, have looked for tariff structures that might draw a company to a British freeport. They find only one big opportunity: dog food.

Yet Mr Sunak has thrown many bones to the eight freeports that will be created in England. They will be given breaks on business rates, property taxes and national insurance contributions. That should be enough to persuade some businesses to move there—if only from other parts of Britain. “We’ve got investors lined up,” promises Mr Houchen. It is, after all, not his job to worry about the country beyond the Tees Valley.■","['valley', 'staff', 'levelling', 'mr', 'local', 'civil', 'london', 'rishi', 'sunaks', 'servants', 'teesside', 'houchen', 'sunak', 'plans', 'tariffs', 'darlington']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
58,['The Economist'],"O N FEBRUARY 14th 1962, the American people fell in love with the White House. Jackie Kennedy, with some help from CBS News, guided 56m of them through her renovations. The tour made such good television that the first lady won an Emmy; and, as Mrs Kennedy intended, the smartened-up White House came to embody the grandeur of American democracy.

Carrie Symonds, Boris Johnson’s fiancee, may have a harder time getting the British public to buy into her plan for sprucing up the prime ministerial quarters in Downing Street. According to a profile in Tatler magazine, she wants to get rid of the “John Lewis furniture nightmare”—a dangerous reference to the department store that is a mecca to the British middle classes—and replace it with something more upmarket. The Daily Mail reports that the plan is to pay for the refurbishment through a privately funded charity.

The plan would offer a solution to a particular problem. Number 10 is a venue for hosting world leaders but prime ministers get only £30,000 a year from the public purse for redecorations, and a parliamentary expenses scandal over claims for duck-houses and moat-cleaning 12 years ago means that Britons are hawk-eyed when it comes to their politicians’ expenses. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, was derided this week when it emerged she had the audacity to claim expenses for Apple AirPods and an iPad. Britons would rather their prime ministers lived in a hovel and their MP s communicate by carrier pigeon than pay for such extravagances as curtains and computers from the public purse.

An alternative would be for Mr Johnson to follow the example of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, who reportedly paid for $1.5m and $1.75m of refurbishments respectively out of their own pockets. That is unlikely to happen. Mr Johnson’s salary, at £160,000, is modest for a world leader, and with a couple of divorces behind him and at least six children, he has a lot of mouths to feed. In the year before he took the current job he earned £829,255, mostly from writing. He had a contract for a book on Shakespeare, which was due to be published last April, four years late; but even the famously productive prime minister has presumably had little time recently to devote to the Bard. Mr Johnson’s publishers are evidently taking a realistic view of his attitude to deadlines, for Amazon now gives its publication date as 2035.","['ministers', 'plan', 'prime', 'carrie', 'white', 'expenses', 'grand', 'mr', 'johnsons', 'public', 'symonds', 'downing', 'world', 'pay', 'plans', 'street']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
59,['The Economist'],"“T HERE’S something going on. I can’t prove it, but I can smell it,” said Gordon Jackson QC , as he concluded the defence of Alex Salmond last March. Mr Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland, was on trial for 13 charges of sexual assault, including an attempted rape, against nine women. Mr Salmond, his lawyer conceded, could be a “bad boy”, but the allegations of criminality were the product of a “murky, murky world” of Holyrood intrigue. Mr Salmond was cleared by the jury. The previous year, he had overturned an internal Scottish government probe into claims by two women, after a judge found procedural errors left the process “tainted by apparent bias”.

The smell lingers, and the proof remains elusive. On March 3rd Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Salmond’s successor, gave evidence for eight hours to a committee of the Scottish government investigating her role in the affair. She faces three broad charges. The most serious, and least credible, is Mr Salmond’s claim that he is a victim of a “malicious and concerted” plot by Ms Sturgeon’s inner circle to send him to jail. The others are more damaging: that she misled the Scottish Parliament about her knowledge of the allegations against Mr Salmond, and that her government wasted public money by pushing on with contesting the judicial review when her lawyers regarded the case as unwinnable.

The inquiry has revealed flaws in Ms Sturgeon’s government, including a dangerous blurring of the lines between party business, government work and the prosecutor’s office. But her performance revealed the rhetorical dexterity that has kept her at the top of Scottish politics since becoming Mr Salmond’s deputy in 2004.

She apologised profusely for the original botched probe. The legal advice on whether to push on was more nuanced than had been portrayed, she said. An out-of-court settlement, for which Mr Salmond had begged in text messages, would have been improper. She shared lawmakers’ frustration at delays in producing documents and wished “her memory was more vivid” of certain meetings. The suggestion of collusion with the police was “stretching the credulity of the most devout conspiracy theorists”. But this was about him, not her. Mr Salmond was a “man I had revered since I was 20 years old”. He had confessed to “deeply inappropriate behaviour”. She regretted that he had no regrets.

The Scottish Conservatives are planning a vote of no confidence in Ms Sturgeon, although no date is yet fixed. She is likely to survive. Her Scottish National Party is on track for a majority in the Scottish election in May, which it hopes will open the door to an independence referendum; even her bitterest internal critics will not jeopardise the “project”. The outcome may hinge on the votes of pro-independence Green MSP s, who under Scotland’s two-vote electoral system risk being punished if they bring Ms Sturgeon down.

Focus groups are said to be sympathetic to her defence: that in the wake of the #MeToo movement, when complaints were raised, her government threw the book at her former mentor. “As first minister I refused to follow the age-old pattern of allowing a powerful man to use his status and connections to get what he wants,” she said. Her main regret, really, was that its aim was off. ■","['nicola', 'debacle', 'sturgeon', 'sorry', 'smell', 'ms', 'little', 'scottish', 'revealed', 'mr', 'sturgeons', 'salmonds', 'women', 'salmond', 'alex']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
60,['The Economist'],"N O PERCH OFFERS an insight into the health of a society like a dentist’s stool. As a young practitioner in Paisley, an old weaving town outside Glasgow once famed for its teardrop-patterned scarves, Anas Sarwar would from time to time be called upon to perform “full clearances” on patients in their late teens, and fit them with dentures. The problem was methadone, a heroin substitute prescribed to addicts which is both acidic and sticky “and would pretty much fry the dentition”. The regional health board has the highest drug death rate in Scotland, which in turn has the highest in Europe.

Alleviating such misery was the historic mission of the Labour Party in Scotland, which Mr Sarwar was elected to lead on February 27th. Towns like Paisley were its firmest strongholds, reliably returning Labour MP s since the war. At its zenith 20 years ago it ran Britain. Scots filled the Cabinet, in the form of Gordon Brown, Robin Cook, John Reid and Alistair Darling, and the ranks of advisers. In 1999, the party created Scotland’s devolved government, and then ran it. It was downhill from there. In 2007, the Scottish National Party took power in Edinburgh. In the 2015 general election, Labour was swept away in a nationalist surge, losing 40 of its 41 Westminster seats. Among them was Mr Sarwar’s in Glasgow Central, a seat previously held for 13 years by his father Mohammad (who now serves as Governor of Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province). The party is now third in the Scottish Parliament, behind the Tories.

The biggest problem for Mr Sarwar, Labour’s seventh full-time leader in Scotland since 2007, is the constitutional cleavage. The independence referendum of 2014, in which Labour campaigned to keep the United Kingdom together, was a centrifuge. The nationalist vote has consolidated behind the SNP , and unionists behind Tories. Labour bled at both ends, just as the party split over Brexit in the rest of Britain.","['reviving', 'stopping', 'rot', 'scottish', 'scotland', 'ran', 'problem', 'nationalist', 'party', 'sarwar', 'mr', 'rests', 'labour', 'future', 'paisley', 'britain']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
61,['The Economist'],"O VER THE past year rent strikes have swept British universities, and even a pandemic hasn’t stopped the finest traditions of student protest. A building has been occupied, barricades stormed and manifestos drawn up. The short-term aim is “a few quid in a student’s pocket,” campaigners say, with many currently paying to rent empty dorms. The grander aim, though, is “resistance to marketisation of both universities and, more importantly for the working classes, housing.”

Left-wing activists instinctively dislike the market; many other students simply feel they get a rough deal from it. On March 8th a small number will return to in-person teaching, with more to follow after the Easter break, a year after the disruption started. They are not a happy bunch. A recent survey by Yonder, a pollster formerly known as Populus, finds that just 36% of British students believe they get value for money. Of the 21 countries polled on behalf of Chegg, an ed-tech firm, only South Koreans feel they get a worse deal.

In Scotland tuition is free and in Northern Ireland it is heavily subsidised but elsewhere students face some of the highest sticker prices in the world. Most of those in England pay £9,250 ($12,900) a year for tuition. Since four-fifths of British students leave home to study, their living costs are high, too. Many do not foresee a strong return on their investment. Graduates in Britain enjoy relatively low wage premiums (see chart), and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think-tank, has found that a fifth of them would have been richer ten years after leaving university had they skipped the experience altogether.","['return', 'valueformoney', 'class', 'feel', 'tuition', 'higher', 'problem', 'english', 'british', 'universities', 'worse', 'students', 'aim', 'yonder', 'educations', 'rent']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
62,['The Economist'],"I N AUGUST 1936 Henry “Chips” Channon and his wife, Lady Honor Guinness, went on an official visit to the Berlin Olympic games along with a bunch of other British grandees. They had a simply wonderful time. They didn’t pull off the ultimate social coup of having dinner with Hitler—the closest they got to the Führer was when he visited the Olympic stadium and “one felt as if one was in the presence of some semi-divine creature”. But the rest of the Nazi elite went out of their way to entertain the visiting Britons.

Hermann Göring was “flirtatious”, “gay” and “charming”. Frau Göring was “tall”, “handsome” and “nearly naked”. The Ribbentrops’ party lent “dignity to the new regime”. Just as thrilling was the spectacle of daily life. Everyone kept raising their arms and saying “Heil Hitler!” in a thoroughly captivating manner. And what about the rumours of terrible things going on in labour camps? Being a responsible MP Chips took a trip to one such camp and was impressed by what he saw. It looked “tidy, even gay”. The purpose of the camps was to wipe out “class feeling”—not something Chips was normally in favour of getting rid of—and such feeling “has become practically non-existent in Germany”. Chips concluded that “England could learn many a lesson from Nazi Germany”.

These vignettes are all taken from the first of what promises to be three volumes of the diaries of Channon, a rich American who climbed the heights of British society in the 1920s and 1930s and also became a Tory MP . The diaries were first published in 1967 in heavily redacted form: many of the subjects of Chips’s indiscretions were still alive and able to sue. Simon Heffer, a journalist and historian, has taken advantage of the passage of time to produce an unexpurgated edition.

The diaries do more than merely titillate. They demonstrate just how many members of the British upper classes were either infatuated with Hitler or at least regarded him as a useful bulwark against Bolshevism. In one entry, Chips described a visit by his uncle-by-marriage, Lord Halifax, a Tory grandee, to Germany to go fox-hunting with the leading Nazis. “He liked all the Nazi leaders, even Goebbels!…He thinks the regime fantastic, perhaps too fantastic to take seriously. But he is v glad that he went and thinks nothing but good can come of it”. (Halifax almost messed up the occasion by mistaking Hitler for a footman.) The diaries also provide yet more evidence of the vital role Winston Churchill played in saving Britain from the pro-Hitler sympathies of the upper classes and the cynical calculations of appeasing politicians. “That…farceur would stir up trouble anywhere”, Chips wrote, “luckily for England and the peace of Europe he has no following whatsoever in the House [of Commons]”.

It is becoming fashionable on the left to dismiss Churchill as a racist. A vandal spray-painted the word on his statue in Parliament Square. During a recent discussion on “Churchill and race” held in, of all places, Churchill College, Cambridge, panellists competed to denounce him as a racist, white supremacist and eugenicist. Churchill certainly said some repugnant things about race. But by the standards of his time he was relatively moderate: he was much less enthusiastic about eugenics, for example, than many heroes of the left such as Sidney and Beatrice Webb, H.G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw and Harold Laski. He was mercifully free of the common vice of anti-Semitism. And as Channon’s diaries make clear he led the battle against the worst racist in history at a time when other members of his party and class thought labour camps wonderful innovations. ■","['nazi', 'flirtation', 'wonderful', 'chips', 'diaries', 'hitler', 'british', 'racist', 'churchill', 'establishments', 'parties', 'camps', 'chronicle', 'went']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
63,['The Economist'],"T HINGS ARE moving quickly in Qaraqosh, a sleepy Christian town just outside Mosul in northern Iraq. Pope Francis arrives on March 7th, four years after Islamic State ( IS ) was chased out. So local priests have been hurriedly cleaning up al-Tahira, their cathedral and one of Iraq’s largest churches. They have refurbished its burnt interior and repaired most of the masonry that the jihadists used for target practice. When your correspondent visited, five days before the pope, smashed chandeliers and a golden crucifix torn down by IS still littered the forecourt. Father Ammar Yako, the priest overseeing the project, says he has received no support from the Iraqi government; the funding has come from Catholic groups in the West. He says he will finish just in time for the Holy Father.

Pope Francis is the first-ever pontiff to visit Iraq, where over 95% of the population is thought to be Muslim. He arrives at a difficult time for its Christians, whose forebears have been in the country since the first century. Churches are being rebuilt, but there are fewer believers to fill the pews. Around 1.2m Christians lived in Iraq in 2003. War and misery have pushed that number down to around 250,000, or less than 1% of the population (see chart). Many of those who left will never come back. But Iraq’s leaders hope that Christians displaced within the country will soon feel safe enough to go home. President Barham Salih says the pope’s visit will help Iraq to “heal”.

The trouble for Christians began after the removal of Saddam Hussein, Iraq’s dictator, in 2003. He had largely protected the group—even making a Christian, Tariq Aziz, his deputy prime minister. But some Muslims view Christianity, despite its long history in the region, as a Western import. Anti-Christian violence increased during the American occupation and turned into an existential threat when IS captured swathes of the country in 2014. The jihadists told Christians that they could leave, convert to Islam or be killed. In August that year, around 100,000 of them fled from the Nineveh Plains, the heartland of Iraqi Christianity, which IS conquered. Some went to Baghdad or to Erbil, capital of the autonomous Kurdish region, but many left the country. An enduring source of resentment towards Christians in Iraq comes from the notion that they can easily claim asylum in the West, says Pascale Warda of the Hammurabi Human Rights Organisation, an NGO in Baghdad.

Aid to Church in Need, a Catholic charity based in Germany, estimates that the war against IS destroyed or damaged 14,936 homes and 363 church properties in the Nineveh Plains. Around 57% of the homes and 11% of the church properties had been repaired by January. Christians have trickled back. But many sold their homes to Muslim families. Others stay away because of a lack of security and jobs. Reconstruction has happened separately from efforts to stabilise the region, says Reine Hanna of the Assyrian Policy Institute, a think-tank in Washington. It reckons that across the Nineveh Plains, 53% of Assyrians, a predominantly Christian ethnic minority, have returned to their villages. But in some areas that number is less than 10%. “When people don’t feel safe, it doesn’t matter if they have reconstructed churches or houses,” says Ms Hanna. The calculations of Christian families often depend on which group controls their home town. At least six groups claim authority in different parts of the Nineveh Plains. They include Iranian-backed and predominantly Shia militias (known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces), Kurdish forces (known as the Peshmerga) and the Iraqi government. In many places portraits of Qassem Suleimani, the late commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, are common. But in towns controlled by the Nineveh Plain Protection Units, a Christian militia, Pope Francis smiles down from billboards. Unsurprisingly, these towns have higher rates of return.

The Iraqi government has made at least some effort to reach out to Christians. It declared Christmas an official holiday last year. But many Christians say it treats them as second-class citizens. They have a tougher time getting government jobs than Muslims. The constitution dating from 2005 is based on Islam. Marriages between Muslims and Christians are frowned upon. Children born of mixed parentage are automatically classed as Muslim, even if the child is a product of rape. In Baghdad, the capital, Christian businesses are often attacked, says Ms Warda. Christian leaders were vocal supporters of big anti-government protests in 2019. Iraqi Kurdistan, in the north-east, is more hospitable to Christians. The Kurdish national project is based on ethnicity, not religion, and the Kurdistan Regional Government ( KRG ) has more provisions for religious pluralism than the Iraqi government has. But the KRG does not always adhere to its own laws, says Ms Hanna, and ethnic tensions can be as febrile as religious ones. Under Kurdish rule “you can be Christian, but you can’t be Assyrian,” she says. Assyrians and Yazidis, another religious minority, felt abandoned when the Peshmerga withdrew from the Nineveh Plains in 2014, leaving the area to IS . Some of that distrust still lingers. Western aid groups have singled out Iraq’s Christians (and Yazidis). USAID , America’s development agency, committed $27.5m (or 2.5% of its total development spending in Iraq) to help people returning to the Nineveh Plains in 2018 and 2019. It was the only district to receive a dedicated stream of funding for resettlement from America. USAID also renegotiated the terms of a $75m contribution to the UN in 2018 that was slated for a stabilisation project in Iraq. The agency made sure that $55m would be spent supporting religious minorities in the Nineveh Plains. When Donald Trump was America’s president, USAID was reportedly pressed to direct more support towards Christians. Most Western countries do not want to be seen favouring one religion over another. But some do not mind. In 2017 Hungary launched “Hungary Helps”, a project aimed at Christians around the world. Tristan Azbej, the Hungarian minister for the aid of persecuted Christians, said in 2018 that the programme’s “flagship project” was the reconstruction of Tesqopa, a predominantly Assyrian town in the Nineveh Plains.

For Christians, as for so many Iraqis, painful memories of fleeing their homes are still fresh. Tempting them away from stable and relatively prosperous places such as Erbil will be difficult. Convincing them to forgo Western visas will be tougher still. Some Iraqis think the pope’s visit will raise awareness of Christianity’s long history in the country and, perhaps, lead to greater understanding between faiths. But Father Yako thinks it will take a bigger effort. “Other communities, especially Muslims, need to do more to make us feel comfortable,” he says.■","['country', 'iraq', 'western', 'plains', 'religious', 'christian', 'heading', 'pope', 'bearing', 'nineveh', 'iraqi', 'project', 'remain', 'cross', 'afraid', 'christians']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
64,['The Economist'],"A T FIRST GLANCE one might have thought the cardboard box was a visiting head of state. On February 13th Lebanon’s first batch of covid-19 vaccines emerged from a jet at Beirut’s international airport. A delegation of officials drove out to meet it; local media broadcast the event live. Never mind that the shipment contained a meagre 28,500 jabs. After a miserable year of pandemic, economic collapse and a catastrophic explosion in Beirut, the vaccines offered a dose of hope.

Scepticism, a pre-existing condition in a country notorious for corruption, prevailed too. Many Lebanese expected the rich and powerful to jump the queue to get their shots. They drew some comfort from the involvement of the World Bank, which in January allocated $34m to fund vaccine imports, enough to cover doses for more than 2m people (a third of the population).

Lebanon was the first country to strike such an agreement with the bank. It came, however, with conditions. The bank demanded transparency. Lebanon would have to set up a system for distributing vaccines. Everyone would have to wait their turn. “There will be no wasta,” said Ferid Belhaj, the bank’s top official for the Middle East, using an Arabic word that connotes nepotism. The health ministry published a plan that allocated the first doses for medical workers and over-75s.

Elie Ferzli is neither. That did not stop the 71-year-old MP and 15 of his colleagues from getting a dose on February 23rd. About half were under 75, and they took their jabs at the parliament building rather than a designated hospital. The World Bank raged. Saroj Kumar Jha, a regional director, said the bank could halt its funds.

A few MP s apologised. Others claimed they were front-line workers in need of protection. Mr Ferzli embarked on a series of televised diatribes, called Mr Jha a liar and urged his bosses to “send a replacement”. He took a further jab at him by mispronouncing his first name as “Farouj”, Arabic for a roast chicken.

The World Bank faced a dilemma familiar to Lebanon’s donors. To do nothing would set a bad precedent, in Lebanon and other countries with similar agreements. But to halt funding would delay an already sluggish vaccine roll-out. So far it has demanded only that the health ministry publish weekly data on vaccine distribution.

Most of Lebanon’s friends have tired of such scandals. The country desperately needs help. Its currency has lost 85% of its value since October 2019. Hyperinflation has pushed more than half the population into poverty, with food prices up fourfold last year. Daily blackouts are growing longer as power plants run short of fuel. Despite a restrictive lockdown imposed in mid-January, Lebanon still has some of the world’s highest rates of new covid-19 infections and deaths.

Almost no one is queuing up to help. The Gulf states have closed their purses, judging Lebanon too friendly with Iran, their arch-rival. Western donors are tired of funding corruption and dysfunction. A pot of $11bn in aid pledged at a donors’ conference in 2018 remains undisbursed because the Lebanese government failed to approve minimal reforms. Talks with the IMF last year went nowhere.

The World Bank has been among Lebanon’s few remaining friends. In January it pledged a $204m loan to provide cash transfers to 147,000 poor Lebanese families for the next year. Even there, though, Lebanon’s leaders found a way to twist the scheme to their advantage. The money will be transferred to Lebanon in dollars but distributed to recipients in local currency at a below-market rate. The Lebanese central bank, in other words, spotted an arbitrage opportunity in humanitarian aid.

Last month gunmen assassinated Lokman Slim, a prominent critic of Hizbullah, the Shia militant group-cum-political party. (The murder, like most such killings in Lebanon, has not been solved and probably never will be.) On March 2nd the pound hit 10,000 to the dollar, its weakest rate ever, which led to angry protests across the country. Gone was the hopeful atmosphere of October 2019, when hundreds of thousands of people turned out for anti-government rallies. The mood has turned dark. Lebanon’s avaricious leaders may need protection against more than covid-19 in the months to come. ■","['jab', 'jumped', 'lebanons', 'bank', 'donors', 'covid19', 'lebanese', 'lebanon', 'queue', 'vaccine', 'friends', 'politicians', 'vaccines', 'country', 'world']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
65,['The Economist'],"W HEN GAY Nigerians took to the streets to join massive protests against police brutality last year, it was not just the police who attacked them. Fellow protesters also hurled insults at them, ripped up their rainbow flags and tore placards from their hands. “I felt like a lot of people just wanted me dead,” says Matthew Blaise, a 21-year-old student.

In many parts of the world the young are far more tolerant than their elders of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) people. But with a few exceptions, such as in Botswana, which decriminalised homosexuality in 2019, young Africans seem to be almost as homophobic as their grandparents.

A survey released last year by Afrobarometer, a pollster, found that only 21% of Africans aged 18-25 would not mind having a gay neighbour, compared with 17% of those aged 66 or older. That makes Africa different from places like Japan, where 92% of those aged 18-29 think homosexuality should be accepted by society, compared with just 56% of those above the age of 50. The homophobia of young Africans is especially worrying, given how numerous they are: half the continent’s population is under the age of 20. And it contrasts starkly with their tolerance in other areas.

In an African Youth Survey last year, conducted in 14 countries and funded by a South African foundation, 83% of young Africans said that more should be done to protect the rights of ethnic minorities, while 64% agreed that “sexual harassment is a problem in my country”. Yet 69% disagreed with the statement: “My country should do more to protect the rights of LGBTQ people.” (The Q stands for “queer or questioning”.) This is not because robust protections for gay rights are already in place. On the contrary, at least 32 African countries still criminalise gay sex, and openly gay people are often abused, beaten up or worse. Only one country, South Africa, has genuinely gay-friendly laws (eg, it allows same-sex marriage). Even there, outside urban liberal enclaves gay people are at serious risk of being attacked or even murdered. Savn Daniel, a Nigerian human-rights activist, wrote on Twitter that people trying to support gay rights as part of a broader struggle against police brutality “should be arrested and prosecuted”. “We’re not wasting lives for such unlawful nonsense!” he wrote. Human rights, he argues, are not universal but “context-specific” and should not be used to upend Africa’s conservative moral values. “They look progressive but they are very, very homophobic,” says Mr Blaise of many of the Nigerians who protest against police brutality. “I see them as oppressors.” Across the continent in Sudan a gay artist, Ahmed Umar, who took part in the revolution that toppled President Omar al-Bashir in 2019, has faced death threats because of his sexuality. “What has this young generation learned from this experience of being under a dictatorship?” he asks. “How can they not see that what they are practising is exactly what they had practised on them?”

Much homophobia is religiously inspired. After the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa has the highest proportion of religious people in the world. It is the only region where the young are just as religious as their parents, according to the Pew Research Centre, a pollster. Conservative strains of Christianity and Islam predominate, whose adherents deem homosexual acts sinful, notes Ayo Sogunro of the Centre for Human Rights in South Africa. Studies suggest that religion in Africa exerts more sway over how people view same-sex relationships than their level of education, whether they live in cities or the countryside, or whether they are on the internet.

Opportunistic politicians often denounce homosexuality as un-African—a depraved Western import. In Uganda’s recent election President Yoweri Museveni tried to smear his opponent, Bobi Wine, by saying “he gets quite a lot of encouragement from foreigners and homosexuals.” Yet during the campaign gay Ugandans were abused not only by Mr Museveni’s supporters but by Mr Wine’s as well.

Despite the risks, young gay Africans are gaining the courage to stand up for themselves. “Queer folk are being assertive right now,” says Basiru Alumbugu of the African Queer Youth Initiative, a network of activists across the continent. The backlash is a sign that gay Africans are more visible than before. A generation ago, they could not organise online, and hardly any would have dared to take to the streets. “We could never have protested 20 years ago,” says Vincent Desmond, a gay Nigerian journalist. In other regions, as more gay people came out, their neighbours eventually learned to see them as normal. Activists hope that will happen in Africa, too. But it takes courage to lead the way. ■","['africa', 'young', 'intolerance', 'south', 'mr', 'gay', 'african', 'rights', 'preyed', 'share', 'queer', 'elders', 'homosexuality', 'africans']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
66,['The Economist'],"I T STARTED WITH a squashed tomato that led to a killing. It has since escalated into clashes that have taken at least 20 lives and a standoff between northerners and southerners that has paralysed Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation.

Last month a porter carrying a basket of tomatoes in the crowded Shasha market in Ibadan, a city in south-western Nigeria, accidentally spilled his cargo, leaving a pulpy mess. An argument with a nearby shopkeeper over the clean-up soon took an ethnic turn. The porter, who spoke Hausa (a language that identifies him as coming from Nigeria’s north), took a blow from a Yoruba man. As the porter fought back, his assailant slumped, mortally stricken.

Word soon spread on social media that a Yoruba man had been killed in the heart of Yoruba land, inflaming long-smouldering tensions in a country divided between its mostly Muslim north and predominantly Christian south. For hours afterwards Hausa and Yoruba traders hacked at one another or burned down market stalls. At least 20 people are thought to have been killed. Thousands, most of them northerners, were forced to flee.

The clash erupted after years of mounting tensions along religious and ethnic lines as well as between (mostly Christian) farmers and (mostly Muslim) herders. The International Crisis Group, an NGO , estimates that fighting between farmers and cattle herders over access to land claimed more than 1,300 lives in just the first six months of 2018. More recent data are sparse, but many Nigerians believe the conflict has intensified and taken new forms. Since December gangs of kidnappers have struck three schools, snatching hundreds of children and holding them for ransom. Although the kidnappers have not been identified or arrested, many Nigerians believe—rightly or wrongly—that they are Hausa-speaking herders. Instead of dousing ethnic hatred, politicians have fuelled it. Last year the governors of six south-western states hired local militias to form a regional security outfit known as Operation Amotekun (“leopard” in Yoruba). These vigilantes have been accused of brutality and even murder. In December and January they reportedly killed 11 people. Also in January, the governor of Ondo ordered thousands of herders to leave land reserves in his state, blaming them for a rise in kidnapping and banditry. After the one-week deadline expired, Yoruba mobs attacked herders, killing some and destroying their property. In protest northern traders and cattle dealers blocked the flow of food and livestock to the south. The blockade is starting to bite. Almost no meat is on sale in the usually bustling Mile 12 market in Lagos, Nigeria’s biggest city and commercial capital. The price of tomatoes (essential for making spicy jollof rice, Nigeria’s unofficial national dish) has shot up. Baskets that once sold for about 5,000 naira ($13) now go for 35,000 naira. In the north, which grows most of the country’s fresh produce, the price of onions and tomatoes has slumped so sharply that many farmers are leaving crops to rot in the fields. The government has since called in the army to clear corridors along which trucks can travel. And after the main spy agency “invited” leaders of the blockade to discuss their grievances—before promptly detaining their president—the traders agreed to call off their protest and allow food to flow south again.

It is not clear whether the government agreed to the protesters’ demands, which included compensation for those who were killed and police protection for northerners in southern states. What is clear, however, is that Nigeria needs better ways to stop its festering grievances from bursting open like rotten tomatoes. ■","['northerners', 'nigeria', 'south', 'nigerias', 'truce', 'spilled', 'tomatoes', 'tomato', 'herders', 'basket', 'paralysed', 'north', 'killed', 'yoruba', 'traders', 'porter']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
67,['The Economist'],"O UTSIDE A POLLING station in El Salvador’s capital city Jennifer Vásquez, a 36-year-old selling water, explains why she voted for candidates from New Ideas, the party of the president, who is just a few years older than she is. “Nayib Bukele has done things no president has ever done before,” she gushes, dressed in a T -shirt the sky blue of Mr Bukele’s party. “We have received packages of food, including tuna and rice, and he is going to send computers to my children.”

Most voters in the country of 6.5m seem similarly smitten. New Ideas won a landslide in the legislative and municipal elections on February 28th. The party, which was founded in 2018—too late for the previous general election—won at least 56 seats in the 84-seat assembly, giving it a two-thirds majority.

The result has shattered El Salvador’s political duopoly. Since the end of the civil war in 1992 politics has been dominated by the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front ( FMLN ), a left-wing party that grew out of guerrilla groups, and the Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), a conservative party that was founded by a former soldier to oppose those guerrillas. Now these parties have fewer than two dozen lawmakers between them.

At first glance Mr Bukele does not seem like a traditional caudillo. The 39-year-old, who was elected president in 2019, wears his baseball cap backwards and broadcasts his every passing thought on social media. An astute publicist, he has enthralled a populace sick of graft. (Three of the previous four presidents have been investigated for corruption; one is now in jail.)

Mr Bukele’s approval ratings, at around 90%, are higher than those of any other Latin American leader. Critics see in his ascendancy a danger to democracy. He controls two branches of the state: the legislature and the executive. His super-majority gives him a chance to shape the third: the legislative assembly must pick a new attorney-general and five Supreme Court judges this year.

Since he came to office Mr Bukele has shown little regard for institutions. “He treats laws like we treat driving regulations,” says Nelson Rauda, a journalist. In February last year, frustrated by lawmakers’ refusal to approve the budget for his security programme, Mr Bukele entered Congress with gun-toting soldiers. In April, after a rise in the murder rate, his government forced hundreds of prisoners (mostly gang members) to huddle together with their hands tied behind their backs, naked apart from their underwear and face-masks. Mr Bukele tweeted the photo, unembarrassed by the risk that jam-packing prisoners might spread covid-19.

He has demonised anyone who opposes him, including businessmen, journalists and politicians; a fact some blame for the shooting of two FMLN activists in January, the worst act of political violence since the end of the civil war. And like other populist leaders, he foments distrust of democratic institutions. Last week he warned, without evidence, of possible fraud, and just before the polls closed he broke electoral law by giving a press conference urging people to vote.

Those in power say the election result will mollify Mr Bukele (along with tweeting furiously about his detractors, he keenly watches his approval ratings). Felix Ulloa, the vice-president, says the “resistance” of the bureaucracy and assembly “generated a confrontational attitude in him”. Others are more worried. “We will see how he governs once there are no obstacles,” says Alex Segovia, an economist and former FMLN official.

Mr Bukele has a lot to tackle. The World Health Organisation has praised El Salvador’s handling of covid-19—the government invested in hospitals and handed out money to ease the economic pain of the pandemic. However, it also imposed lockdown rules so harsh that the Supreme Court ruled some of them unconstitutional. And these measures contributed to an economic contraction of close to 9% in 2020, among the worst in the region. Public debt is around 90% of GDP . Crime, corruption and poverty remain entrenched.

Mr Bukele claims to have no ideology; he says he simply wants to get things done. But he has no plan, says Bertha Deleón, his former lawyer who cut contact with the president after his gun-toting antics in February. “Everything is pure publicity,” she says. His advisers are typically yes-men. Some are his brothers: one heads his party; another led his presidential campaign. His record so far is decidedly mixed.

Drifting to demagoguery

Take corruption, which he has vowed to curb. Early in his term, he set up an independent anti-corruption body. But his government has produced no evidence of how it has spent the hundreds of millions of dollars it received from donors during the pandemic. When the anti-graft body sent to the attorney-general evidence suggesting mishandling of such aid, the government obstructed the investigations. In November the police, who like the army now seem loyal to Mr Bukele rather than the state, stopped agents from entering the health ministry to gather more evidence relating to procurement contracts, including those with companies owned by ministerial relatives.

Since Mr Bukele took office the murder rate has fallen, as he often reminds voters. He has given the security forces better pay and fancier equipment. He has also dispersed them around the country to areas with particularly high criminality. But criminologists point out that the homicide rate has been falling since 2015, before Mr Bukele was in charge (see chart). The International Crisis Group, a think-tank, says that one reason why crime has ebbed is that the state may have cut deals with gangs. Such deals often backfire in the end. Meanwhile, extortion remains as common as ever. By one estimate, it costs El Salvador 3% of GDP a year.","['el', 'salvadors', 'populist', 'state', 'salvadoreans', 'president', 'evidence', 'party', 'mr', 'rate', 'bukele', 'nayib', 'including', 'salvador', 'elections', 'love']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
68,['The Economist'],"B RENDA GUTIéRREZ , a 50-year-old shellfish gatherer, knew she was a Chango for as long as she can remember. When she was growing up in a fishing village in northern Chile, her parents always called her Changuita (little Chango girl). Her schoolmates, alas, called her “smelly” and “dirty” because of her indigenous roots.

Such discrimination turned her into an activist. She lobbied for the Chilean state to recognise her people, an indigenous group whose culture is supposedly extinct. “We exist and are alive,” she says. In October last year, the Changos won recognition. And an election next month for a convention to change Chile’s old constitution could boost them further.

The Chango—a colonial-era term which has stuck—are descended from nomads who inhabited South America’s west coast over 10,000 years ago. Despite their culture having supposedly vanished, 4,725 Chileans defined themselves as Chango in a 2017 census, in the “other” category. Many still work as hardscrabble nautical types, as their ancestors did (they were known for sea-lion skin rafts). Some still use ancient tools such as the chinguillo, a net fibre bag to carry fish, and the chope, an iron file to scrape molluscs off rocks.

One reason why people mistakenly thought they no longer existed is that the Chango people, who are thought to have come from a number of different tribes in coastal areas of northern Chile, tended to assimilate. (By, for example, abandoning their native languages for Spanish.) And unlike other groups, such as the Diaguitas (recognised in 2006), most of them did not see any need to be officially acknowledged. According to Luis Campos, an anthropologist, many were politicised only after a fishing law in 1991 and its amendments in the 2000s limited fishing to certain areas.

Chileans are growing more aware of their indigenous compatriots. Over the past two decades more have appeared in official statistics. Some 13% of Chileans are now recorded as indigenous, up from around 5% in the census of 2002.

In October last year the Chango were added to the list of peoples entitled to benefits under the Indigenous Peoples Law of 1993. This law offers scholarships and economic development grants. It also provides a chance to reclaim ancestral land. More recognition is coming, too. Elections for the body to draft a new constitution will take place on April 11th.

The constitutional convention will have 155 members. Seventeen seats have been reserved for indigenous groups. Their votes could be crucial to achieve the two-thirds majority required to approve each clause of the new constitution, thinks Antonia Rivas of the Centre for Intercultural and Indigenous Research.

For activists such as Ms Gutiérrez, who is standing as a potential candidate at the convention, such influence could transform Chile. The country is still recovering from huge protests against inequality in late 2019. The various indigenous groups (such as the Mapuche, who are 10% of indigenous people in the country) were not mentioned in Chile’s constitution, drawn up in 1980. Now they will have a seat at the table to draft the new one.■","['change', 'supposedly', 'sea', 'constitution', 'chileans', 'groups', 'chile', 'indigenous', 'fishing', 'say', 'law', 'thought', 'convention', 'chango']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
69,['The Economist'],"E ACH DAY this week some 100,000 Chileans aged 60 to 64 turned up to get their inoculation against covid-19. Having vaccinated nearly 20% of its adults, the sixth-best performance in the world, Chile is on track to meet its target of covering 80% of its 19m people by June 30th. After starting with health workers, the jabs are being applied in strict descending order of age, a different year each day, and to teachers, too.

This swift and orderly programme contrasts with the rest of Latin America. In vaccination as in other matters, the region displays its divisions, inequalities and problems of governance. In this case, sadly, they will cost lives. Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and several smaller countries have barely started jabbing. Mexico, with 2% of its people vaccinated on March 1st, is below the world average of 3.5%. In Brazil (4%) vaccination trails behind the new P .1 variant of the virus, which spreads faster than the original and seems to disregard prior natural immunity. This week the health secretaries of Brazil’s 27 state governments declared that the country is suffering “the worst moment” of the pandemic.

The slow roll-out is largely because of the worldwide shortage of vaccines, especially from Western drug firms whose supplies have gone mainly to their home markets. Argentina, Brazil and Mexico plan to make vaccines but have found it hard to source the active ingredients and vials. Part of the problem is government fumbling. Whereas the African Union made bulk pre-purchases, Latin America’s lack of regional co-ordination meant that countries raced against each other, points out Ernesto Ortiz of the Global Health Institute at Duke University. In that race, Chile did two things right: in mid-2020 it agreed with several pharma companies to host vaccine trials to encourage early delivery; and its immunisation programme has an up-to-date digital database. Many other governments have struggled with complex procurement negotiations.

The result is “patchiness”, according to Clare Wenham, a health expert at the London School of Economics. Different vaccines, different priority groups and different distribution plans could complicate opening up the region’s economies, she thinks. This patchiness owes much to political manipulation. Vaccine distribution in Brazil has been particularly haphazard, because the federal government of Jair Bolsonaro, a populist who denies the seriousness of the virus, has absented itself from the job.

In Mexico, another federal country, the government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador seized control of the vaccination programme from the states. With an important election due in June, it decided that 333 “highly marginalised” municipalities should get the vaccine first. Many are rural and less hit by the pandemic than the cities. Teachers have been jabbed before nurses, who are at higher risk.

This is queue-jumping on behalf of a political clientele. Elsewhere it is the powerful who have jumped queues. In Peru the health and foreign ministers resigned last month after it emerged that they were among 487 insiders who secretly benefited from sample doses provided by Sinopharm, a Chinese company, as a sweetener; another was Martín Vizcarra, who was ousted as president in November. Health ministers in Argentina and Ecuador left after similar scandals. These affairs have done no good for the credibility of democracy in their countries. They also “play against trust in vaccination programmes”, says Dr Ortiz. Polls suggest vaccine hesitancy has risen in Peru since last August.

Those vaccines currently available in the region come mainly from China and Russia, which have been quicker to deliver than their Western rivals. China trades a lot with and invests a lot in several Latin American countries. Vaccine diplomacy may give it soft power for the first time. As for Russia, it had almost disappeared from Latin America since the end of the cold war. Now it is back, and in a benign guise.

Vaccination is a marathon, not a sprint. By February 27th Latin American countries had ordered 550m doses of Western vaccines, compared with 213m from China and 72m from Russia, according to Duke University. Later this year, the Western doses should arrive in force. Eventually, both the scandals and the source of the early vaccines may be forgotten if the region acquires immunity and new variants are kept at bay. But it is more likely that the botched vaccination effort will have lasting political and diplomatic consequences.

70,['The Economist'],"L AST MONTH retailers in Manila went on a two-week “pork holiday”. That was not a fad diet, nor even a few days off scarfing sausage and bacon. They simply refused to sell the stuff, in protest at a price cap imposed by presidential decree.

Pork is a staple in the Philippines. Prices have recently soared, to over 400 pesos ($8.25) for a kilo of pork belly, more than double the norm. The rise has spurred inflation, which hit a two-year high in January of 4.2%. Both houses of Congress have held hearings on rising food prices. On February 1st the harried government instituted a 60-day price cap on pork of 300 pesos a kilo in Manila. It swiftly vanished from shops’ shelves, and a pricey black market emerged.

The fiasco stems from an outbreak of African swine fever, a contagious disease that is deadly to pigs, which arrived in the archipelago in 2019. It has devastated the backyard farms where most pigs in the Philippines are raised. Last year the government launched the Integrated National Swine Production Initiatives for Recovery and Expansion, or INSPIRE , to replace the animals that had expired. It will provide piglets and feed to farmers—but it will be some time before those little piggies get to market.

In the meantime, the authorities have promised to “go after” smugglers and profiteers. They have shipped trucks of live hogs to the capital from islands to the south, notes Fermin Diaz, the editor of Livestock and Meat Business, or LaMB, magazine. And they have increased quotas for certain categories of imports.","['sell', 'price', 'pesos', 'refusing', 'pig', 'retailers', 'kilo', 'philippines', 'swine', 'went', 'pigs', 'prices', 'cap', 'mistake', 'pork']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
71,['The Economist'],"G ONE IS THE carnival atmosphere that pervaded Yangon, Myanmar’s biggest city, during the first weeks of protests against a military coup on February 1st. The protesters have exchanged tongue-in-cheek placards for home-made shields and tiaras for hard hats, the better to fend off the increasingly violent security forces. For most of the past month the army—notorious for violently crushing past democracy movements—had responded with water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas, but nothing worse. But as the demonstrations have worn on, the junta has grown more vicious. Soldiers have begun firing live ammunition into crowds. On March 3rd, the bloodiest day so far, at least 38 people were killed, according to a UN official.

The army, or Tatmadaw as it is known, clearly hopes the shootings will persuade the protesters to go home. Some have: the streets are no longer thronged with hundreds of thousands of them, as they were in late February, but they are far from empty. Young protesters are just as likely to be demonstrating as older, hardened activists. A giggly 17-year-old university student who was consumed by her passion for K -pop until the coup says she became a “little bit afraid” after her friend was tear-gassed. Despite the danger, she insists, “I have to protest.” She is still doing so most days.

Opponents of the coup are steeling themselves for a long fight. They hope that, by convincing enough workers to go on strike, they can throw a spanner in the machinery of state. Teachers, doctors, railway workers, truck drivers, customs agents and other bureaucrats have not been going into work for weeks. Neither have many employees at banks, whether state-owned or private. As a result, most of the country’s 2,000 private bank branches have been shut since February 8th, according to Frontier, a local magazine. Banks have also placed caps on withdrawals from cash machines or suspended them altogether.

There are other signs of economic distress. Over the past month the kyat has depreciated by at least 6.5% against the dollar. Imports of fuel, on which Myanmar relies heavily, have stalled. The World Bank is no longer disbursing funds for $350m-worth of projects. Some foreign investors, especially those in business with conglomerates owned by the army, are packing their bags. Lim Kaling, a Singaporean businessman, is relinquishing his stake in a tobacco company in which one such conglomerate, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited ( MEHL ), is the biggest shareholder. Kirin, a Japanese brewer, has also withdrawn from a joint venture with MEHL .

The civil-disobedience movement “is starting to paralyse the state”, writes Richard Horsey of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank. There are doubts about how long the generals will be able to pay wages. This is particularly embarrassing since Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief, would like to be seen as a better manager of the economy than Aung San Suu Kyi, the civilian leader he overthrew. The longer the strike goes on, the more inept and weak he looks.

The rising death toll is not the only sign of the junta’s mounting frustration. The security services have been trying to force workers back to their jobs. In mid-February, notes Anthony Davis, a security analyst, the exhausted police were reinforced by light-infantry divisions—battle-hardened troops typically dispatched to fight ethnic militias on the country’s periphery. One of the units in question was implicated in a pogrom in 2017 against the Rohingya, a persecuted ethnic minority. There have been reports of violent rampages through neighbourhoods with especially persistent demonstrations. The army is also using surveillance drones and shutting off the internet between 1am and 9am.

The top brass may be hoping that the damage to the economy cuts both ways. Some participants in the civil-disobedience movement are running out of money. Htay Win, who owns a roadside tea shop in Yangon, has almost no savings left. His business was closed for seven months last year, owing to covid-19 restrictions. He closed it again in early February so that he could join the protests. Given his parlous finances, he thinks he will have to re-open soon, at least part-time.

Many other demonstrators have no intention of giving up the fight. Almost a month after the start of the civil-disobedience movement, the number of people participating continues to grow, says Moe Thuzar of ISEAS , a think-tank in Singapore. Aye Thidar Oo, a typist at a municipal office in Yangon, declares, “It might be a year, two years, ten years: I will carry on striking until the end.” Nann Yin Htwe, a worker at a garment factory, says her salary was so low that she has nothing to lose by striking. She is receiving food and contributions to her rent from several of the many grassroots aid organisations that have sprung up to help striking workers. She is proud to be out of work, she says.

Mr Davis suspects there are hardliners in the army who advocate swifter, harsher repression to stem the erosion of morale. Two previous agitations for democracy, in 1988 and 2007, ended in massacres. In both cases the army hesitated for over a month before crushing the protests. ■","['brutal', 'month', 'striking', 'response', 'security', 'past', 'myanmar', 'growing', 'army', 'shooting', 'workers', 'protests', 'armys', 'movement', 'starts', 'protesters', 'yangon']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
72,['The Economist'],"M USHTAQ AHMED , a Bangladeshi writer, knew the risk he was taking. To attack his government’s handling of covid-19, not least by likening the health minister to a cockroach, as he did on Facebook last spring, was to challenge the Digital Security Act. Passed in 2018 by the thin-skinned regime of Sheikh Hasina Wajed, now in her fourth term as prime minister, the law penalises such vague crimes as “creating confusion” and “tarnishing the image of the country”. Mr Ahmed was one of some 450 people arrested under the law last year. Even so, the 54-year-old did not, presumably, expect to languish behind bars without trial for nine months, be denied bail six times and ultimately die in a prison hospital, as he did on February 25th.

On the same day, in neighbouring India, the government rolled out new guidelines for social media, video-streaming and digital publishing with reassuring patter about pride in Indian journalism and “soft touch oversight”. Rather than a draconian law, broad in scope and heavy on punishment, the official government gazette merely recorded the “exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1), clauses (z) and (zg) of sub-section (2) of section 87 of the Information Technology Act, 2000”.

Yet India’s new rules conceal sharp teeth and a long reach. They make messaging services and social-media firms such as Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook far more responsible for the material posted by users. And they sharply curtail the relative freedom enjoyed by purveyors of online content, from news sites to Netflix.

In January Twitter first complied with and then resisted an official demand to suspend more than 1,000 accounts, mostly of supporters of a long-festering mass protest by farmers. Now all social-media firms and online publishers will be obliged to remove content promptly at the government’s request, to reveal the source of any post (and so to break the encryption that many chat services rely on to protect users’ privacy), and also to comply with peculiarly cumbersome procedures to respond to public grievances. In an echo of Bangladesh’s law, the government can request the removal of any material it says contravenes Indian law, causes harm to national interests or stirs internal unrest.

Although the guidelines talk of self-regulation, bureaucrats must approve the membership of any industry body formed for this purpose. Any decisions such an outfit makes can be overruled by a government panel, which will also decide whether a media firm has responded adequately to complaints from the public. Given that the Hindu nationalist supporters of Narendra Modi, the prime minister, often troll his critics, firms fear they will be swamped by spurious complaints and then punished for failing to answer them all politely, in a timely fashion. A government initiative to recruit volunteers to assist the police in patrolling the internet could end up generating still more burdensome complaints.

Many argue that the rules infringe constitutional guarantees of free speech and privacy. They are also alarmingly broad and vague: it is unclear whether print publications that also post their output online are subject to the guidelines, and whether and how oversight will be extended to foreign firms. Legal challenges are inevitable.

Social-media firms worry that the erosion of privacy could cause an exodus of customers. When WhatsApp told its 530m Indian users in January that it might share some of their information with its parent company, Facebook, so many dropped the service that it hastily scrapped the change. Digital news outlets, which include some of the fiercest critics of Mr Modi, worry that they will be saddled with an impossible regulatory burden by a government that has already tamed most media.

The government retorts that the internet needs the sort of self-regulating industry groups, codes of conduct and state supervision to which television broadcasters, print media and the film industry are already subject to varying degrees. Nikhil Pahwa, a digital-rights campaigner, doubts it will back down, unless blocked by the courts, even if the new rules drive out big foreign firms. When the government banned dozens of Chinese apps last year, he notes, Indian entrepreneurs eagerly leapt into the breach. During its dispute with Twitter, many of Mr Modi’s supporters pointedly abandoned the service for a little-known Indian rival.

Even if the government does have to retreat, online critics will not relax. In February police raided the home of Prabir Purkayastha, the owner and editor of NewsClick, a site that often berates Mr Modi. They kept him under house arrest for four-and-a-half days as they rifled through his possessions. On March 3rd tax authorities raided properties belonging to several Bollywood personalities who, unusually for an industry that typically fawns over the powerful, had criticised Mr Modi. One was Taapsee Pannu, an actress whose sin may have been a social-media post: “If one tweet rattles your unity, one joke rattles your faith or one show rattles your religious belief, then it’s you who has to work on strengthening your value system.” ■","['indian', 'supporters', 'media', 'regulation', 'modi', 'firms', 'policing', 'mr', 'web', 'law', 'indias', 'follows', 'twitter', 'bangladeshs', 'users', 'online', 'social', 'industry']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
73,['The Economist'],"A USTRALIANS ARE proud of their country’s impressive if stringent handling of the coronavirus pandemic: just over 900 deaths to date out of a population of 25m, with a mere eight or so new cases each day. That achievement is one reason why the scene after the men’s final at the Australian Open tennis tournament late last month shocked so many. In her comments at the presentation of the trophy, before both local spectators and a global television audience, Australia’s tennis chief suggested it was a time for “optimism and hope”, with vaccinations “rolling out in many countries in the world”. Australia’s programme was to begin the following day. Yet instead of cheers, her remarks were drowned out by the boos of anti-vaxxers in the crowd.

The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, called the behaviour “disgusting” and sought to portray the jeerers as party-poopers. His boss, Scott Morrison, was injected before the cameras with one of the 60,000 shots in the country’s first shipment of vaccines. Most of the rest are for front-line health and quarantine workers. The government promises swift progress, after an admittedly slow start.

Yet reluctance to receive vaccines is an issue. Anti-vaxxers have marched in Melbourne and Sydney. In many countries, vaccine acceptance has risen sharply along with the prospects of getting a jab. But a study by Imperial College London of global attitudes towards covid-19 vaccines found that Australia was one of four out of 15 rich countries in the Americas, Asia and Europe where vaccine acceptance fell between November and January. Strikingly, the other three are also in Asia: Japan, Singapore and South Korea. They too have impressive records handling the pandemic, with just 7,984, 1,612 and 29 deaths respectively. These countries’ relatively slow roll-out of vaccines compared with Britain and America, let alone Israel, may soon turn them from laurel-winners to laggards in the fight against covid-19.

Misinformation, conspiracy theories and distrust of Chinese vaccines have contributed to the hesitancy. But so too, argues Tikki Pangestu of the National University of Singapore, has an awareness that new and seemingly improved vaccines keep appearing. Singaporeans of a certain age say that, given the virus’s ongoing mutations and the possibility that antibodies may not work for ever, they would rather hold off until they really need a jab—and then get the very latest and best. Others worry about possible side-effects. In South Korea half of those polled say they would rather see what happens elsewhere before receiving a vaccine. With cases low and normal life resuming, the risks of delay strike many in Singapore and South Korea as negligible.

This foot-dragging is mirrored by governments. South Korea pinned early hopes on home-grown vaccines, putting in orders for foreign-made ones only in November. In Japan the government has a rocky history of lawsuits over possible side-effects from measles and mumps shots. It does not want to look as if it is rushing things. In fact, rather absurdly, it has demanded extra clinical trials of covid-19 vaccines on Japanese people specifically as a condition of approval. The vaccination of health-care workers began only last month. The elderly will not get jabs before April. Most of the rest of the population will not start being vaccinated until midsummer. That hardly improves the chances of holding a normal Olympics in Tokyo in July.

Shortages of supply, largely beyond governments’ control, will also cause delays. Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, warns that there will not be enough vaccines for everyone until the third quarter of the year. It may take until the end of the year to complete the vaccination programme.

Whatever the cause of the sluggish roll-out, it is of greater concern than might at first be obvious considering that the countries concerned have such low infection rates. In contrast to Europe and North America, success in curbing covid-19 means they have virtually no herd immunity. Moreover, Asian governments’ rapid travel bans suggest a high aversion to risk. That is unlikely to change. Even a mooted travel “bubble” between Singapore and Hong Kong is on hold. Dr Pangestu predicts that Singapore, for one, will remain “obsessive” about not quickly reopening its borders, even for inbound travellers with covid-19 “passports”. They are no guarantee that you are not infectious, after all. If Banyan had to bet on when Asian travel will resume, it will not be this year.","['singapore', 'travel', 'slow', 'south', 'countries', 'banyan', 'korea', 'governments', 'covid19', 'workers', 'vaccinate', 'vaccines', 'vaccine', 'fast', 'curbed']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
74,['The Economist'],"S INCE CHINA imposed a draconian security law on Hong Kong last year, protests in the city—already dampened by pandemic-related controls—have been rare. But on March 1st hundreds of people gathered outside a court to demonstrate against the largest case so far related to the security bill. They held banners calling for the release of “political prisoners” and chanted slogans that were popular during the unrest that engulfed the territory in 2019. Students at a primary school nearby stood outside their classrooms, shouting in solidarity. It was a rare act of defiance in a city that, to many residents, feels crushed.

A day earlier, 47 people had been charged for alleged misdeeds as part of the case. They included some of Hong Kong’s best-known pro-democracy activists, such as Leung Kwok-hung, a veteran campaigner commonly known as “Long Hair”; Lester Shum, a politician; Benny Tai, an academic, and Joshua Wong, whose then-teenage face became emblematic of the “Umbrella Movement” of 2014 (he is already in prison for a protest-related offence). They have been accused of crimes such as conspiracy to commit subversion by plotting to overthrow Hong Kong’s government.

The case relates to an informal primary ballot that was held last year to select pro-democracy candidates for elections to the Legislative Council. This sensible-sounding effort was seen by the government as an attempt to gain control of the council and paralyse its work. (The elections were due to be held in September but were postponed for a year, purportedly because of the pandemic.) If convicted, the defendants face sentences of up to life in prison.

The proceedings that began on March 1st relate to applications for bail—the trial itself may not begin for several more weeks. Under the security law, there is a presumption that bail will be denied, so even this stage has involved protracted debate in court and a gruelling ordeal for the defendants. They have had to endure sessions lasting many hours that have eaten into normal times for meals and sleep. The physical toll has been evident—several of them have received hospital treatment. On March 4th 15 members of the group were granted bail. They will remain in custody pending an appeal by the prosecution, which argues that they could pose a threat to national security if released.

No national-security trial has yet been concluded. So this one will be watched for signs of how the new law—which has the hallmarks of Chinese mainland-style legislation, with its vaguely defined political terms—works in a judicial system steeped in British legal tradition. Dominic Raab, Britain’s foreign minister, has described the case as “deeply disturbing”. America and the European Union have called for the release of the 47 activists. On March 2nd Hong Kong’s Department of Justice said that prosecutors’ decisions had been made “without political considerations” and no one should interfere in them. But a few days before the 47 were charged, Xia Baolong, a central-government official who oversees Hong Kong affairs, had said that “anti-China elements” should be “severely punished under the law”. He had named two members of the group: Mr Wong and Mr Tai. The Communist Party may be an exception to Hong Kong’s rule. ■","['bill', 'security', 'kongs', 'political', 'trial', 'case', 'held', 'wong', 'law', 'biggest', 'kicks', 'hong', '47']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
75,['The Economist'],"I N ITS HEYDAY in the 1960s and 1970s, the village of Dazhai was called a place of miracles. Millions of revolutionary pilgrims came to hear how local peasants had carved terraced grain-fields and reservoirs from its rocky hillsides, armed with little more than hand tools and love of Chairman Mao Zedong. Dazhai’s barely literate Communist Party secretary, Chen Yonggui, was summoned to Beijing and elevated to the Politburo with the rank of vice prime minister. Back then Liang Jiwen was a schoolboy, the son of a Dazhai official. He recalls dignitaries arriving each day in his corner of Shanxi province, in the dust-dry Taihang mountains. He and classmates would wave flowers and sing red hymns at the roadside. “We did not get much studying done,” he recalls.

Then came the fall. In 1980, as part of a broader purge of ultra-leftists that followed Mao’s death in 1976, official Communist Party newspapers called Dazhai a fraud. Investigators charged that its miraculous grain harvests were invented. They described massive cash subsidies channelled to the supposedly self-reliant village, and thousands of soldiers sent to build its engineering marvels.

Now Dazhai is trying for a third act. Local officials have drawn up plans to include their village in a China-wide official campaign to promote “red tourism” and teach party history to the masses. They are pinning particular hopes on their former “people’s commune”, a well-preserved complex of cave dwellings built in 1966. An evocative place, its entrance gate still decorated with Maoist slogans, it was admitted to a national register of protected sites in 2013. It is still closed to the public, but plans are afoot to buy out current residents. Among them is Jia Cunlian, a widow who has lived in a cave-home there for 30 years. She remembers Chen, the Mao-era boss, as “the best of people”, who shared exotic gifts that he had received with villagers, such as melons or raisins. Still, she prefers the present day, saying: “Life was hard back then.”

Since the 1990s, most visitors to Dazhai for tourism have been elderly. The village has tried to woo them with nostalgia: family-owned restaurants serving rural dishes, including tree-bark noodles once eaten during times of famine. But local leaders have grander ambitions now, involving what would amount to Dazhai’s political rehabilitation. To achieve that, officials are willing to offer doses of candour. Shi Yonghong, who heads the cultural relics bureau of the surrounding county, Xiyang, admits that Mao’s call to “Learn from Dazhai” led to excesses by the mid-1970s, such as when communes in other parts of China dug terraced fields out of flat plains in their anxiety to obey the chairman. Mr Shi blames officials in these places for misinterpreting the policy, adding that Dazhai never asked to be a national model. But even that grudging admission of long-ago problems is offset by his claims that Dazhai not only fed itself during the hungriest years of the 1960s, but “sold surplus harvests to the state”. He offers no further details to back up that long-debunked assertion. Instead, he talks vaguely but grandly about the “Dazhai spirit”, which he defines as hard work and not asking for government handouts.

In an office thick with cigarette smoke, overlooking a snow-covered village square, Dazhai’s deputy party secretary, Li Huailian, chimes in. She describes the village’s story of hardships as a way to understand what President Xi Jinping means when he tells gatherings that the good times of today did not fall from the sky. Dazhai is prosperous because its people have always been diligent and followed party orders, she declares. “Where the party tells us to go, we go.” At first hearing, that is a rather insipid summary of her village’s tumultuous past. But these local officials know what they are doing. They want Dazhai to be a celebrated red-tourism site, promoted alongside revolutionary bases on the route of the Long March. To achieve that, they need to grasp the role that history plays in the Xi era. To Mr Xi and his team, the past exists to provide reasons to admire the party, not to furnish evidence for judgments about its rule.

Not just popes who like to claim infallibility

Real history is dangerous stuff. Past adulation of Dazhai and of its boss, Chen—a zealot who ordered 141 political executions and said that revolutionaries could grow grain on sandy beaches—is a reminder that to Mao, party rule was a faith-based project. It often put ideology above expertise and common sense, with horrific results. Dazhai’s denunciation in 1980 reflected moves by China’s then-paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, to create a rational, technocratic state. Deng’s gamble was that the party did not need personality cults to maintain support. Instead, he sought a mandate based on making China strong and prosperous. To make a case for market-based reforms that he believed vital to that project, he was pragmatically willing to allow Maoist mistakes to be named.

Mr Xi favours a synthesis of these two approaches. As the party approaches its 100th anniversary in July, its leaders urge the public to contrast China’s economic rise and social stability with economic decline and political chaos in the West. That is a Deng-style appeal to performance legitimacy. Yet that co-exists with boosterish talk of “the brilliant achievements and valuable experience accumulated by our party”. Maoist disasters are not mentioned. In the Xi era, when Chinese scholars dwell on past mistakes they are guilty of “historical nihilism”, a career-ending offence. When foreigners remember old horrors, the charge is that they seek to overthrow Communist rule. Last month Mr Xi gathered senior leaders to stress the importance of studying party history correctly, to pass “red genes and revolutionary fire” to later generations.

Mr Xi seeks a mandate that is both pragmatic and faith-based. The common thread is absolute loyalty. By the logic of the Xi era, the Chinese are able to benefit from wise party rule today because they always trusted the party, even when it erred. Objectively, Dazhai does not deserve to be a place of pilgrimage again. Still it may happen. In China, the past is what the party needs it to be. ■","['red', 'village', 'rule', 'dazhais', 'officials', 'tourism', 'history', 'xi', 'party', 'past', 'local', 'chaguan', 'dazhai', 'xis', 'china']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
76,['The Economist'],"O N THE MORNING of November 13th last year Zambia’s vice-president told parliament, “This country will not default.” Hours later the inevitable happened. Having destroyed its relationship with the IMF , struggled to provide clear data on its borrowing from China and failed to win a reprieve from bondholders, Zambia missed a deadline to pay interest and defaulted on its debt. Lenders could only shake their heads in bemusement.

For some poor countries like Zambia, a debt crisis has always been the story of a chaotic and corrupt government that has borrowed carelessly. But in the more complex creditor landscape of today, defaults can also, more than ever, be about struggling nations stuck in the web of diplomatic feuds that bind their creditors together. Each lender enters restructuring talks with the same preoccupation: is someone else getting a better deal? No one wants to be first to give concessions and there is little advantage in showing your hand. More than financial data or legal frameworks, it is these power struggles that have come to define restructuring negotiations.

The pandemic has left many countries struggling to repay their debt. As well as Zambia, five others—Argentina, Belize, Ecuador, Lebanon and Suriname—defaulted last year. For some, health-care and social spending rose just as the global economy tanked. In other cases, like Zambia’s, covid-19 provided an excuse for a profligate government to default. Others could run out of money in the months ahead.

The last time a large number of poor economies were crumbling under the weight of government debt, around the turn of the millennium, the group of creditors was smaller. It included multilateral organisations like the IMF , a handful of commercial banks, and rich countries like Britain and America operating in unison as the “Paris Club”. An unusual mix of other players, including Bono, an Irish rock star, and Pat Robertson, an American televangelist, generated widespread support for debt forgiveness, but even then it was difficult. The resulting programmes—the Heavily Indebted Poor Country ( HIPC ) and Multilateral Debt Relief ( MDRI ) initiatives—have saved 37 of the world’s poorest countries over $100bn.

Drop the debt again?

Things are more complicated now. Poor nations have borrowed from new lenders. China and Saudi Arabia have lent a lot of money to developing-world governments. And as yields on rich-country debt have plummeted, poor governments have been able to sell foreign-currency bonds. The average portion of emerging-market public external debt owed to multilateral institutions dropped from 43% in 2008 to 34% in 2019, according to World Bank data crunched by Fitch Ratings, while the share for commercial lenders (largely bondholders rather than banks) jumped from 29% to 45%. Meanwhile, bilateral lending fell.

With the creditor landscape transformed, lenders are looking at recent negotiations, including those in Ecuador and Zambia, for signs of how future resolutions might take shape. Two new power struggles have emerged.

The first is between Chinese lenders and everyone else. The second is between Wall Street and Washington, where official-sector lenders like the IMF and the American government are based. For the 50 most-indebted recipients of Chinese lending, the average stock of debt owed to China reached 15% of GDP in 2017 from less than 1% in 2005, according to data from a group of experts including Carmen Reinhart, a Harvard academic now at the World Bank. Because of the political competition between Beijing and Washington, this lending is—often unjustifiably—framed as a devilish ploy to cripple poor economies and grab strategic assets. People think of China “in almost conspiracy-theory terms”, says Meg Rithmire of Harvard Business School. Governments in Zambia and Ecuador have been renegotiating their debt with one eye on elections this year. In a sign of just how contentious the issue is, the front-runners in the poll in Ecuador, which also owes a lot to China, are running on opposing economic plans: Andrés Arauz promises to scrap the existing deal with the IMF , whereas Guillermo Lasso wants to rebuild investors’ trust.

Beyond suspicion and rivalry, Chinese lending has specific characteristics that complicate talks. The first step in any restructuring is calculating how much a country owes and to whom. That is a thorny business when China is involved. What analysts refer to as “Chinese lenders” includes a variety of institutions, such as state-owned enterprises and policy banks, which act on behalf of the government. “They’re not all on the same team,” explains Deborah Brautigam of the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University.

Keeping track of all this lending is tricky, too. Much of it goes undeclared, and confidentiality clauses prevent governments from sharing the terms of their loans. That has been a stumbling block in Zambia. To offer support, the IMF needs information on loans from China that have been agreed upon but are yet to be handed out, meaning they do not show up in public accounts. Foreign bondholders, who have lent a total of $3bn, have refused to provide a reprieve for fear that their funds will be used to pay off Chinese lenders.

Everyone is seeking clues about the extent to which Chinese lenders will join co-ordinated debt negotiations. So far, they seem eager to look like they are engaging with other creditors. But they are changing their ways gradually, following the Chinese proverb and “crossing the river by feeling the stones”. Policy banks have deferred payments on loans to the Zambian and Ecuadorean governments, but details are patchy. Similarly, China joined the G 20 in its Debt Service Suspension Initiative ( DSSI ) announced last year, to pause repayments on bilateral debt for 73 of the poorest nations, and in its “common framework”, which provides longer-term help. But it has curbed the power of the DSSI by treating some policy bank loans as commercial, so they are not part of the standstill. As for the other main power struggle, it pits official lenders like the IMF and creditor governments, which have a long history of lending to the developing world, against commercial lenders that make money doing the same. Here, too, trust is an issue. Abebe Selassie, director of the IMF ’s African department, points out that one of the biggest recent scandals around undisclosed loans involved European banks, including Credit Suisse. Some $2bn of questionable debt that was taken on by state-owned enterprises in Mozambique in 2013 and 2014 eventually crippled the local economy and forced the government into default. “Transparency is about all lenders, not just China,” says Mr Selassie. More worrying still is disagreement on the responsibility a fund manager sitting in London or Hong Kong has to a poor-country government. Private-sector lenders have come under pressure to offer concessions, even to solvent governments. Some bondholders, like Yerlan Syzdykov at Amundi, say they have a fiduciary duty to generate returns for clients and that it is not their job to “provide financial aid” to poor governments. “We’re not charities,” he says. Besides, renegotiating foreign-currency bonds might not be in the interest of poor economies if it leads to a credit downgrade, making it more expensive to raise money on international capital markets in future.

Egos involved

Bondholders nowadays are a disparate group. Some funds hold on to debt for a while; some are opportunists, buying bad debt when prices nose-dive. They all have different goals, which is why they have split into multiple committees in recent talks, including those in Argentina. The same fund managers pop up in all emerging-market debt restructurings, too. There are big personalities involved and personal feuds linger.

A government trying to restructure its debts needs not only to get all lenders onside but to do so in the right order. The Paris Club will negotiate only once a country has an IMF programme in place and demands debtor countries ask other lenders for concessions comparable to their own. That is why Iraq, with vast oil reserves and foreign troops on the ground, began negotiations with the rich-country group before other lenders, winning a 90% reduction (in present-value terms) of its Saddam-era debt stock that it could then ask other creditors to match. A country that lacks geopolitical clout is unlikely to get an easy ride from bilateral lenders and might follow a different strategy. “This is a major tactical question for a sovereign that has both Paris Club and commercial debt: what is the right sequence?” says Lee Buchheit, a lawyer who specialises in sovereign debt.

The key to breaking the deadlock between various creditors is often the IMF . Other lenders are more willing to give a government a break when they have data, an economic plan and the promise of supervision from the Fund. “What you generally want is an honest broker,” says Jan Dehn at Ashmore Group, an emerging-market investment manager. In the case of Argentina, the IMF struggled to play that role because it was one of the creditors seeking repayment.

As for Ecuador’s restructuring last year, which was wrapped up in a matter of months, it was crucial that the government had kept up good relations with the IMF . Its request to postpone $800m in coupon payments was conditional on thrashing out the beginnings of a new deal with the IMF . Over 90% of bondholders agreed to the pause and then to a restructuring when the time was up.

Ecuador, a serial defaulter, had some experience navigating its creditors. Not so with Zambia, which sold its first foreign-currency bond as recently as 2012. It wrecked its relationship with the IMF when it kicked the Fund’s previous representative out of the country in 2018. The only reason for optimism now is that Zambia’s new IMF representative flew to Lusaka in December, followed soon after by Mr Selassie, raising hopes that a new programme might break the deadlock.","['creditors', 'debt', 'imf', 'countries', 'lending', 'lenders', 'zambia', 'fight', 'default', 'governments', 'option', 'struggling', 'help', 'chinese', 'china', 'poor']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
77,['The Economist'],"G ERMANS ARE used to being top of the class. Early in the pandemic, when Germany controlled its outbreak better than most of the West, they felt they were. In vaccinating citizens against covid-19, by contrast, the country has been a laggard. One in 20 has received a shot, compared with nearly a third of Britons, a sixth of Americans and, as Die Welt, a daily, recently grumbled, even a tenth of Moroccans.

German bosses are losing patience. Many workers at the industrial firms that dominate corporate Germany are vulnerable to covid-19 because factory or construction jobs cannot be done from home. Nearly all companies in the DAX 30 blue-chip stockmarket index, as well as countless CEO s of smaller firms, are therefore preparing to launch their own immunisation drives. They include BASF and Bayer (in chemicals), BMW and Volkswagen (carmaking), Deutsche Wohnen and Vonovia (property development) and RWE (energy).

The vaccines will come from the government, which has the doses but apparently not the capacity to get them quickly into arms. Firms are buying ultra-cold freezers for shots that need such storage. The jabs will be administered by company doctors. Germany has between 15,000 and 20,000 of them (not counting nurses), many more than other European Union countries, America or Britain. About one-third of them are employed directly by firms and the rest run practices that serve employers in their area.

Anette Wahl-Wachendorf of VDBW , an association of company doctors, hopes that from April such medics will be able to dispense jabs alongside family physicians and 400-odd public vaccination centres. They may reach perhaps 45m employees and their relatives, she reckons. That is more than half of all Germans.

“As soon as we get the vaccine, we will get started,” promises Rolf Buch, boss of Vonovia. His firm has already set up centres that will, starting this month, test employees who wish to return to the office for the virus. These venues will be used to vaccinate its 10,000 employees and adult members of their immediate families, in keeping with official guidelines on who gets priority.

German labour law allows companies to give bonuses to workers who get vaccinated for any illness (though not at this time to make vaccination mandatory). Such carrots are common in America, where Aldi and Lidl, two big German supermarkets, are offering workers payments of up to $200 to roll up their sleeves. Neither grocer, nor any other big German firm, is currently planning to use such incentives at home, for fear of the controversy this might cause (see article). Still, Mr Buch expects the vast majority of his staff to accept the offer of free shots. Those who decline may be barred from office parties and other group activities.

Once Mr Buch is done with Vonovia employees and their families, he is willing to turn the company’s centres over to the general vaccination effort. Other bosses are starting with the broader population. In early December, before the first vaccines were approved for use in the EU , business folk in Bremen, a city in north-west Germany, launched a campaign to convert an exhibition centre next to the central railway station into a giant vaccination site. Kurt Zech, a hotel-and-construction tycoon, contributed furloughed staff. Mercedes, a carmaker, threw in tables and chairs. Another company donated laptops. A software firm adapted its programs for use in a call centre that helps residents to schedule appointments.

Thanks to the pushiness of Bremer businesspeople, up to 16,000 of their fellow burghers a day will get jabbed from mid-March, more than ten times what the local government had planned. Their goal is to have 70% of the city’s adults inoculated by the end of July, months ahead of the government’s schedule. ■","['charge', 'company', 'firms', 'firm', 'germanys', 'dax', 'employees', 'vaccination', 'germany', 'workers', 'drive', 'vonovia', 'centres', 'companies', 'vaxxers', 'buch']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
78,['The Economist'],"T HE PANDEMIC is throwing up a new set of ethical issues for businesses. The premise of “stakeholder capitalism” is not just that firms should consider the interests of employees and customers, as well as shareholders. It is that, by doing so, everyone gains; shareholders will prosper if workers and customers are treated decently. But the pandemic may put different groups at odds. For example, customers may want companies to insist that all employees are vaccinated, while not wanting the same rule to apply to themselves.

It might seem as if shareholders would want as many employees to return to work as possible, few potential customers to be excluded, and interactions in, say, shops and restaurants to be as free from restrictions as possible. But if a company gets a reputation for being an unsafe place to work, or for customers to visit, the effect on long-term returns could be significant. The perception of fairness is also essential. Woe betide the executive who jumps the queue, as in the case of Mark Machin, a Canadian pension-fund boss who travelled to the United Arab Emirates to get the jab. (He swiftly resigned.)

Companies are not just trading off safety and personal liberty. They risk discriminating against those who have yet to gain access to the vaccine or who, for religious or medical reasons, are unwilling or unable to be jabbed. And they do not have complete freedom of action. The legal situation will vary from country to country but it seems likely that, in many jurisdictions, companies will be able to insist on a vaccine mandate only for new employees.

The question of vaccination is particularly pressing in health care. One might hope that medical workers would appreciate the need for it. Yet some health-care personnel may feel that having had covid-19, as many have, negates the obligation. Laura Boudreau of Columbia Business School in New York observes that, in this type of industry, “there is a duty for the employer to try to identify safe roles that the staff can play, and if not, to provide information to customers about whether there are unvaccinated staff in the role.” In other words, unvaccinated staff may end up being kept away from vulnerable patients.

Rules in other industries often lack consistency. Early in the pandemic, cruise ships helped to spread the disease. The Saga cruise line, which targets elderly travellers, is now insisting that passengers produce proof of vaccination, but makes no such demand of the crew. That makes sense. The passengers will largely be drawn from the rich world, where the elderly have been first in the queue for jabs. The crew will be younger and often from poorer countries. In both cases vaccines will have been harder to obtain. However, the industry is not taking a consistent approach. Swan Hellenic is insisting on vaccines for crew, not passengers. Victory Cruise Lines has made a jab mandatory for both groups.

No vaccine is 100% effective. It is not yet clear whether people who have been vaccinated can still transmit the disease to others. So where staff come into contact with customers, companies may insist on social distancing or mask-wearing until case levels drop substantially. Even then, employees may catch the virus from each other.

Later, companies will have to consider what they should do when vaccines become more widely available. Some staff may have been unable to get a vaccine, because they have a medical condition (such as pregnancy) that excludes them. Do companies have a duty of care to protect such employees from colleagues who have refused to take the jab on principle?

In the case of most companies, Ms Boudreau says, it is very much in their interest “to reduce barriers for eligible staff to get vaccines, to have a dialogue with their staff to understand if and why they may be hesitant to get vaccinated, and to provide information and resources that may help those who are reluctant”. But that is probably as far as they can go.

There may be another phase of the pandemic with new variants resistant to current vaccines. The type of jab people have received then becomes more significant. In short, managers will face a series of trade-offs. Their best option may be to accept the uncertainties, remain flexible, ensure the best possible hygiene standards for their staff—and hope that acquired immunity, vaccines and therapies make covid-19 no more life-threatening than seasonal flu.","['bartleby', 'staff', 'vaccinated', 'jab', 'customers', 'employees', 'vaccines', 'vaccine', 'pandemic', 'companies', 'shareholders', 'handle']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
79,['The Economist'],"W HICH ECONOMY contracted most sharply last year? That dubious honour almost certainly belongs to Macau, a former Portuguese colony that is now part of China. On March 5th the autonomous region’s statistical agency is expected to announce that GDP fell by at least half from 2019. Unsurprising, perhaps, given that the covid-19 pandemic has dealt a blow to Macau’s sole engine of growth: casinos. Gross gaming revenue in Macau, the only place in China where casinos are legal, plummeted from $36bn in 2019 to $7.5bn last year. The first two months of 2021 brought little respite.

Yet despite collapsing revenues and heavy pre-tax losses, share prices of Macau’s six casino operators have held up remarkably well (see chart). Three of them are worth more than they were before the pandemic. Recently, after reporting that annual revenues had fallen by three-quarters, the biggest, Galaxy Entertainment, saw its market value swell to $42bn. Investors also reacted with a collective shrug when MGM China, a listed subsidiary of Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts International, disclosed a similar drop in its top line.

Why are investors feeling lucky? First, Macau expects a speedy recovery in visitors from mainland China, who account for seven in ten non-Macanese punters. For much of 2020 virus-induced travel restrictions stemmed their flow. Last month Macau exempted all mainland visitors from quarantine. Today the casino hub is the only jurisdiction with which the mainland has a two-way travel bubble.","['revenues', 'aflutter', 'china', 'travel', 'macau', 'winning', 'bet', 'mainland', 'visitors', 'mgm', 'pandemic', 'investors', 'galaxy', 'macaus', 'entertainment']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
80,['The Economist'],"W ALL STREET’S glass ceiling cracked at last on March 1st, as Jane Fraser took charge of Citigroup, becoming the first woman to head a big American bank. That cracking sound has also been echoing across the rest of America Inc. Last year Carol Tomé became boss of UPS , a package-delivery giant. In January Rosalind Brewer became only the third black woman ever to run a Fortune 500 company (Walgreens Boots Alliance, a pharmacy chain). A month later Thasunda Brown Duckett was picked to run TIAA , a big pension fund. America ranks below the average for the OECD club of industrialised countries in The Economist’s annual glass-ceiling index of female empowerment, owing to poor marks on parental leave and political representation. But it has a high share of women in management (41%) and on company boards (28%). In both cases America outpaces egalitarian Germany, which in January enacted a quota for female board members (and where the shares for management and boardrooms are 29% and 25%, respectively).

Most countries have a long way to go. Just one in three managerial positions across the OECD ’s 37 members is occupied by a woman. A recent study by SIA Partners, a consultancy, found that in Britain bias against women in senior corporate hiring remains systemic.

At least signs of progress can be seen even in traditional laggards like Japan. Mori Yoshiro had to resign as chief of the Tokyo Olympics in February after he complained that women talked too much in meetings. A woman replaced him.","['appear', 'lot', 'executives', 'countries', 'company', 'run', 'cracks', 'improving', 'oecd', 'management', 'female', 'america', 'women', 'woman', 'members']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
81,['The Economist'],"F ROM DRIVE-IN cinemas to drive-through restaurants, Americans love doing things without getting out of their cars. During the covid-19 pandemic they have taken to shopping in a similar fashion, too. Kerbside pickup, where buyers’ vehicles pull up to retail outlets and dedicated staff help load online orders into the boot, helped supermarket chains notch up a banner year. One in two American shoppers used kerbside or in-store collection last year, according to a survey by ShipStation, a maker of shipping software.

No big retailer in America can do without kerbside pickup. Those that had it before the pandemic, including Target, Walmart and Kohl’s, have expanded their offerings. On March 2nd Target reported record digital sales, which accounted for two-thirds of revenue growth last year. These were powered by such “drive-up” purchases, which ballooned more than six-fold in the final quarter of 2020. Shops that lacked kerbside operations hurriedly created them from scratch. Some analyses have found that around 60% of American retailers now have the service, twice the share 12 months ago.

Even malls, which were struggling before the pandemic added to their woes as self-isolating consumers moved en masse to online purchases, are giving it a whirl. Sarah Fossen, head of marketing at Rosedale Centre, a mall near Minneapolis with 150 retail tenants, recalls starting a service with parking space set aside for kerbside pickup at two entrances, only to discover that there was sufficient demand to add such space at all five main entrances.

Successful efforts get a number of things right, says Tom Enright of Gartner, a research firm. Some of the imperatives are straightforward (install clear signs, offer sufficient parking space). Others require retailers to make bigger changes; since they do not have to lug stuff to their car themselves, for example, kerbside shoppers often buy bulkier crates of bottled water or bigger bags of pet food. A bit of technological nous comes in handy. Some retailers are, for instance, using location tracking in their apps to know when exactly customers might arrive, so as to minimise waiting times, says Jean Chick of Deloitte, a consultancy.

Some waiting will be inevitable. But, says Mike Robinson, who used to run digital operations at Macy’s, a big department-store chain, the period in line need not be wasted. Lingering customers could be enticed with other offerings, from promotions to new products, in the same way that you might grab a chocolate bar while waiting at the cashier. It is “the perfect time” to engage shoppers, Mr Robinson says.

Many shops still have to crack important aspects of this transition. Most are not equipped for returns or exchanges and lack a seamless way for customers to add and pay for last-minute items. Retailers could improve the experience with pop-up tables in the parking lot stocked with popular items. As Mr Enright notes, “If kerbside is going to replace an in-store experience, it has to bring a lot of those in-store experiences out into the parking lot.” ■","['pickup', 'instore', 'lot', 'hybrid', 'shoppers', 'parking', 'retailers', 'drivethrough', 'rules', 'pandemic', 'kerbside', 'waiting', 'space', 'shopping', 'right']",2021-03-04 00:00:00
82,['The Economist'],"P EOPLE HAVE to eat, so food firms the world over give reassuringly consistent profits, even in lean times. Mexico is no different. The country’s 126m people buy $55bn-worth of packaged food annually. Sales of such fare have been growing quickly, notes Euromonitor, a research firm. Between 2015 and 2020 they expanded by 6.9% a year, compared with 4% in America.

This trend should have lifted the likes of Bimbo, the world’s largest baker, and Gruma, its biggest maker of tortillas. Instead, like many Mexican businesses in recent years of sluggish economic growth, they have fallen out of favour with investors. Stable profits notwithstanding, their market capitalisations are well below their peaks in the mid-2010s.

To whet the stockmarket’s appetite for their shares, both firms are doubling down on foreign markets. America’s packaged-food market alone is nearly ten times the size of Mexico’s. A loaf of Bimbo bread that costs $1.76 in Mexico sells for $2.77 north of the border. Bimbo has also acquired several big American brands, most notably Sara Lee, a maker of poundcakes and cream pies, in 2010.

These investments may at last be paying off, partly thanks to the pandemicinspired rush to comfort food. In 2020 Bimbo’s sales in America and Canada rose by 22%; operating profits in the region shot up by 84%. IRI , a data firm, puts it among the fastest-growing big consumer-goods companies in the United States. Revenues north of the Rio Grande helped push Bimbo’s total sales to a record $16bn. Operating profit hit $1.2bn. Gruma attributed its own strong results last year to a growing fondness for tortillas among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Americans alike.

Further expansion will not be a cakewalk. Bimbo’s bread and butter is simple fare that legions of poor Mexicans can afford. To succeed in richer places like America the company will have to cater to more upper-crust consumers with varied tastes. It is now experimenting with niche and premium products. Last year the Bimbo-owned New York Bakery launched gluten-free breads. Gruma has introduced naan and pita breads in some markets. Lala, a dairy company that is Mexico’s third-biggest food firm, has got into organic milks.

Some of those innovations may come in handy at home, too. As the share of Mexican who are obese has hit one-third, up from one-fifth in 1996, Mexico’s government has developed a growing distaste for unhealthy food. In October it introduced a law forcing firms to label foods high in calories, sugars, salt or bad fats. Both bread and tortillas qualify. ■","['profits', 'breadwinners', 'bimbo', 'firms', 'sales', 'firm', 'food', 'growing', 'abroad', 'mexicos', 'bread', 'sell', 'gruma', 'tortillas']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
83,['The Economist'],"T HE WEEK in financial markets got off to a breezy start, belying the turmoil of the previous week. By the time the New York market closed on March 1st, the S & P 500 index of leading shares had risen by a carefree 2.5% on the day. Europe’s stockmarkets had already followed Asia’s lead in closing sharply up. The mood in Asia was helped by Australia’s central bank, which acted to calm bond-market nerves by announcing it would intervene to buy long-dated government paper. Yields on ten-year Aussie bonds, which had risen quickly since New Year’s Day, fell by some 0.25 percentage points.

Stockmarkets gave up Monday’s gains on Tuesday and Wednesday. But conditions in America’s government-bond market were somewhat calmer, in stark contrast to the week before, when anxiety about inflation took hold. The steady fall in bond prices since the start of the year had suddenly quickened to a pace that threatened a destabilising rout. During February 25th the benchmark ten-year Treasury yield spiked above 1.6% (bond yields move inversely to prices). That is still low by historical standards, but a lot higher than it started the day, or indeed the year. This prompted a big one-day fall in the S & P 500 and a bigger fall in the tech-heavy NASDAQ . Almost as suddenly, the worst fears about inflation have receded again—but perhaps not for long.

Much of what has happened is to be expected. Bond prices ought to fall as the economy recovers. The ten-year Treasury is the benchmark bond and is thus a barometer of risk appetite in markets and of economic confidence more broadly. And it is global benchmark. The sharp rise in Treasury yields from the start of the year until February 25th was matched by yields on bonds in other places (see chart 1).

Bond prices move in the opposite direction to confidence; bond yields go in the same direction as confidence. When the outlook for the economy is bleak, as it was in March last year, yields fall sharply as investors rush to the safety of bonds. As the outlook brightens, bond prices start to fall and yields start to rise again. Bond prices are thus countercyclical most of the time. This feature makes them very attractive diversifiers for equities, the prices of which are more procyclical, moving up and down in tandem with the economic cycle (see article). Mild inflation is not to be feared. Indeed it is in part changes in the market’s expectations of inflation that drive bond yields down in recessions and up in recoveries. But hopes for a reflation of the economy can quickly spill over into fear of higher inflation. The case for this seems stronger than it has for many years. The American economy is recovering quickly. Fiscal transfers have left households with lots of extra savings. Lockdowns have given rise to pent-up demand. Already there is plenty of fuel for a spending spree when the economy reopens in earnest. And more is on the way. President Biden’s $1.9trn stimulus package is likely to become law this month. A jump in the annual inflation rate seems assured in the coming months, if only because prices were depressed a year ago. Perhaps, then, the strength of consumer spending, as people start to move around more freely, might further push it up. These latent anxieties form the backdrop to the recent turmoil. Three factors in particular seemed to be at work. First, the market for future short-term rates started to price in interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve by early 2023, sooner than the Fed had indicated thus far. You can call this the inflation-fear element: if the economy seemingly has this much momentum behind it, can the Fed really hold off from raising rates for very long? And if it tightens sooner, might the peak in interest rates be higher? That would be a big concern for America’s stockmarkets, where high prices relative to future earnings are largely justified by the expectation that interest rates will remain very low for a long time. Second, just as the market was having a rethink about Fed policy, the Treasury held auctions for two-year, five-year and seven-year bond issues on February 25th. These are maturities that are sensitive to shifts in expectations about Fed policy in 2023-24. Indeed the one-day rise in the five-year-bond yield was notable (see chart 2). The auctions went poorly. The seven-year bond had the lowest bid-to-cover ratio (a gauge of excess demand) for an issue of its kind for more than a decade. This further spooked the market about the underlying demand for bonds.","['bondmarket', 'rise', 'scares', 'ready', 'bond', 'start', 'inflation', 'fall', 'bogeyman', 'prices', 'market', 'treasury', 'yields', 'economy']",2021-03-01 00:00:00
84,['The Economist'],"M OST PEOPLE have little time for quants. They find the language of quantitative finance far from illuminating. Even fairly numerate people struggle to grasp what comes easily to pointy-headed number-crunchers. Take the idea of correlation, the co-movement of two or more variables. Such relationships vary with the period over which they are measured. The direction can shift. Things quickly become confusing.

Yet the quant argot is useful when considering perhaps the biggest fear stalking financial markets: a sustained rise in inflation that would be bad for both equities and bonds. A quant might describe this as a flip in the bond-equity correlation from negative to positive. That is none too elegant, though. A better choice is a term used in geopolitics as well as econometrics: regime change.

It is helpful in this matter to start with two stylised facts. The first is that in recent years, bond and equity prices have tended to move in opposite directions over the business cycle. When recessions hit, bond prices tend to rise sharply (their yields fall) and equity prices usually crash. When the economy recovers, bonds tend to fall in price and equity prices go up again. You can think of this in terms of risk appetite. Government bonds are safe assets. People rush into them when they fear for the future. Equities, by contrast, are risky assets, so people shun them in troubled times.

The second stylised fact concerns a secular relationship rather than a cyclical one. Since the early 1980s bond and equity prices have moved in the same broad direction—upwards. If you look at low-frequency data over a long period, the bond-equity correlation is positive. This is best understood in terms of yields rather than prices. For the past four decades, there has been a secular decline in government-bond yields, reflecting a secular decline in interest rates. The earnings yield on equities has fallen, too, as have yields on other assets, such as corporate bonds and property. This should not be a surprise. Yields are a gauge of expected returns. Bonds and equities compete for investors’ capital. Over the long haul the prices and yields of each will respond to those of the other.

These two facts may seem at odds, but a third fact makes them consistent. In each business cycle, interest rates tend to rise as the economy gathers strength (so bonds and equities diverge over short periods). But each business-cycle peak in interest rates is lower than the previous one (so bonds and equity prices converge over the long run). That in turn is a response to the secular decline in inflation.

Indeed, inflation is central to the bond-equity relationship. It is here that things become trickier, and the notion of regime change matters. Bonds promise fixed cash payments in the future. Those cashflows are worth less when inflation unexpectedly rises. By contrast, equities have generally outpaced inflation over the long haul. But the relationship between inflation and equity prices is not stable. A study by Sushil Wadhwani, a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting committee, in 2013 found that higher inflation generally helped to boost stockmarket returns in Britain in the two centuries before 1914. But by the last half of the 20th century a negative relationship had emerged. You might best explain this finding in terms of monetary regimes. Under the pre-1914 gold standard, inflation was mean-reverting: if it was high one year, it would fall the next. But in the era of fiat money, especially in the 1970s, the checks on inflation were less binding.

In the past few decades central banks were given inflation targets, and the monetary regime switched again. Now, yet another regime change may be afoot. Fiscal stimulus is back in favour, which has an unsettling 1970s feel to it. Fiscal policy fell out of fashion because it was not well suited to fine-tuning aggregate demand; politicians are reluctant to cut spending or raise taxes when the economy threatens to overheat. And the old-style central banker—reared in academia, aloof from politics, paranoid about inflation—is now almost extinct. The new breed talks about climate change and inequality and is sanguine about inflation risks. This feeds a general sense of lost policy discipline.

Sooner or later, warn the hawks, this will end in tears. Many of the people who predict the return of 1970s-style inflation used to deride the old-school, bookish rate-setter, with his fancy econometrics and lack of market smarts. It is no small irony that they now feel so nostalgic for the pointy-headed central banker.","['buttonwood', 'bonds', 'secular', 'yields', 'inflation', 'worried', 'equities', 'equity', 'regime', 'prices', 'bondequity', 'relationship', 'long']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
85,['The Economist'],"S UPPLIERS HATE being made to wait for the cash they are owed almost as much as their customers hate parting with it. What if high finance could help? Specialist firms have indeed sprung up, offering to pay suppliers up front, then cashing in their customer’s cheque as the bill comes due weeks later. By charging fees or a spread, the intermediary takes a cut for what is in effect a loan. But the woes this week of Greensill Capital, a provider of such supply-chain financing, highlight some of the risks lurking in overlooked bits of the financial system.

Greensill, founded just ten years ago, boasted it could help companies “unlock capital”. Using techniques mastered by erstwhile slicers-and-dicers of subprime mortgages, it transformed the bills it took on into bond-like investments. These could be sold to outside investors, such as hedge funds, desperate to find some yield in a low-interest world. As long as the customers kept settling their invoices, a tidy profit could be made for investors—and the financiers behind all the alchemy. By 2019 Greensill claimed to have arranged financing worth more than $140bn to over 10m customers.

Questions over whether the money would indeed keep flowing were never far away. As concerns mounted over the creditworthiness of the companies Greensill had to collect money from, the value of the bonds underpinned by the invoices wobbled. On March 1st Credit Suisse froze $10bn of funds stuffed with paper sourced by Greensill. The Swiss investment bank warned of “considerable uncertainties” with respect to the valuation of the bonds linked to Greensill.

Within days Greensill itself was fighting off bankruptcy. The firm is said to have sought relief from insolvent-trading laws in Australia, where part of its corporate set-up is based (its founder, Lex Greensill, is Australian). By March 3rd it was reported by the Financial Times to be preparing to file for insolvency in Britain, where it conducts much of its business. Apollo Global Management, an American private-equity giant, has been in talks to buy at least part of the franchise, at a fraction of the $7bn value Greensill, which had planned to list its shares, once hoped to achieve.

The swift downfall of a once-lauded financial firm will reverberate beyond the niche world of trade finance. Greensill had worked up a profile as a scrappy innovator while also courting the establishment (David Cameron, a former British prime minister, was flaunted as an adviser). Mr Greensill, who said the idea for the business came from seeing his farmer parents run into financial difficulty, and who is now in his 40s, became a youngish billionaire. After a previous sticky patch in 2018 the firm had received $1.5bn in investment from SoftBank, a Japanese investment group fond of backing wildly ambitious undertakings.

Regulators are now wondering whether the model highlights risks they ought to have fretted about. On March 2nd BaFin, Germany’s financial watchdog, took over control of a bank Greensill runs there, closing it to new business. It has filed a criminal complaint against the bank’s management, accusing it of manipulating its balance-sheet. (Greensill says it followed its auditors’ advice and was complying with the regulator’s previous requests.)

Another concern is what will happen to companies that used Greensill’s services to access capital. One noteworthy borrower is Sanjeev Gupta, an Indian-born industrialist who has snapped up steelmaking assets in Britain and beyond. Greensill was a big provider of finance to the GFG Alliance, a group of firms controlled by Mr Gupta’s family; Mr Gupta also once owned a stake in Greensill itself. It was transactions linked to loans to Mr Gupta’s empire (which has not been accused of wrongdoing) that prompted BaFin to step in. A spokesman for GFG said it had adequate funding, even as reports emerged of talks to secure loans from other sources.

The episode will also shine a light on the world of supply-chain financing. Fans of the practice point out it keeps money flowing even as some cash-strapped businesses keep suppliers waiting for months to be paid. But its accounting treatment is tricky. There is evidence that some struggling businesses may seek to hide spiralling debt piles by using supply-chain-finance techniques. Creative forms of financing work best when they rely on conservative accounting. ■","['investment', 'widely', 'capitals', 'customers', 'money', 'woes', 'firm', 'mr', 'finance', 'financing', 'financial', 'reverberate', 'world', 'greensill', 'accounts']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
86,['The Economist'],"T HE PHRASE “first in, first out” has become shorthand for China’s experience of the covid-19 pandemic: it is both where the virus started spreading and the first large country to control it. Its early failure and subsequent success will be studied by epidemiologists for years to come. But for economists and investors, it is another “first in, first out” that matters more at the moment. China was the first country to open its lending and spending taps in the face of the coronavirus downturn. Now, it is the first to start to close them, giving others a partial preview of what the end of stimulus will look like.

Parallels between countries are, of course, imperfect. China required less stimulus because its workers went back to factories and offices nearly a full year ago. But a few general conclusions can still be drawn about its return to more normal monetary and fiscal policies.

The most notable is its gradualism. On March 5th, after The Economist went to press, the government was set to announce its budget for 2021. It was widely expected to target a smaller fiscal deficit this year, probably about 3% of GDP , down from last year’s 3.6%. Factoring in other quasi-fiscal measures such as spending by government-linked companies, China’s true fiscal deficit will be about 12% of GDP , compared with a record high of 15% last year, according to Morgan Stanley, a bank. That is a retrenchment, but still higher than its deficit in 2019, of roughly 10% of GDP .

The central bank has also been cautious. It has withdrawn liquidity to guide up market interest rates and to slow the growth in bank lending. But both the price and quantity of credit remain more generous than before the pandemic struck. “They are aiming to avoid a sharp turn in the policy orientation,” says Zhu Ning of the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance. With 2021 marking the start of a new five-year plan for China, officials will be racing to launch infrastructure projects. The new plan—an important part of the policy process in China—promises big expansions of railways, power lines and more. That, Mr Zhu says, should help offset the end of the coronavirus stimulus.

The tightening, however gradual, is bound to be bumpy. In the past couple of weeks global markets have been roiled by the rise in Treasury yields in America. China went through a similar squeeze in late January when the central bank was far stingier in its open-market operations than expected, leading to a spike in overnight borrowing rates. Stocks fell sharply, though recovered when the central bank eased up. Officials may have wanted to put investors on notice. They have also sounded warnings about asset prices. On March 2nd Guo Shuqing, the top banking regulator, warned of bubbles in the Chinese property market and global financial markets.

As well as China has done in taming covid-19, its policy normalisation still depends on the course of the pandemic globally. Domestic travel remains limited amid lingering concerns about the virus and international travel is largely blocked. A slow roll-out of vaccines in China means there is no chance that it will fling open its doors to the world soon.","['deficit', 'policy', 'fiscal', 'zhu', 'unwind', 'test', 'stimulus', 'bank', 'growth', 'pandemic', 'central', 'gdp', 'track', 'starts', 'went', 'china', 'taper']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
87,['The Economist'],"“T HE WRITER of this piece deserves a big raise,” says Bret “The Hitman” Hart, a professional wrestler from the 1990s. “He is the best there is, the best there was, the best there ever will be,” he adds, echoing his old catchphrase. Your correspondent paid Mr Hart $150 to sing his praises.

Mr Hart is one of over 10,000 celebrities on Cameo, an online service where anyone can commission famous people to film short messages. Its popularity has surged as celebrities seek new sources of income and confined consumers look for ways to spend money. Last year they paid some $100m for 1.3m videos, more than in the previous three years combined. Talent on the site ranges from Jack Nicklaus, a golfer ($1,000 per clip), and Vicente Fox, a former president of Mexico ($300), to Barkley the Dog, a dog ($5).

Cameo, like Uber, is a two-sided market. But most Uber users don’t care what car shows up, as long as it is clean, safe and gets them to their destination. On Cameo, the emotional connection between a fan and a star matters. “The price that a market will bear depends on the value being created for a potential customer,” says Jill Avery, a professor at Harvard Business School who has studied how online influencers price themselves. But “value” is hard to measure when it comes down to emotion.

How do celebrities figure out their fees? One way is through a simple opportunity-cost calculation. Steven Galanis, Cameo’s boss, recalls speaking to a basketball player on an annual $25m contract. For a 40-hour work-week with a fortnight of holiday, that is $208 per minute. “If he charged $100 and did two or three a minute, he could make more money on Cameo,” says Mr Galanis.

Most celebrities are freelance, though. They can try one of two strategies, says Ms Avery. One is “price skimming”—starting high and then lowering the price as demand ebbs. The second is “price penetration”, pricing low to maximise volume. Celebrities often use both, depending on how much time they have.

Another method is to test the market. This is surprisingly underused. Though celebrities can change their prices as often as they like, only about 30% have done so at least once, and less than 10% have done so more than five times.","['value', 'uber', 'price', 'celebrity', 'best', 'fame', 'worth', 'celebrities', 'cameo', 'paid', 'market', 'hart', 'online']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
88,['The Economist'],"T HERE ARE few greater honours than becoming finance minister of your country. But there are better and worse days to start the job. Chatib Basri became finance minister of Indonesia, the fourth-most-populous country in the world, on May 21st 2013. That was only a day before the start of a financial sell-off known as the “taper tantrum”. Yields on American Treasuries rose abruptly after Ben Bernanke, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, spoke about reducing (or tapering) the Fed’s bond purchases. Higher American yields shattered the appeal of emerging markets, undermining their currencies, bonds and shares. “I had very little time to adjust,” Mr Basri noted in 2016.

Policymakers in emerging markets now fear a second such tantrum. As Treasury yields jumped at the end of last month, a broad index of emerging-market shares fell by over 7% in little more than a week. This is “shaping up to be a bruiser”, wrote Robin Brooks of the Institute of International Finance, a bankers’ group, on Twitter. Markets have calmed down in recent days. But if they again lose their composure, which emerging economies will be worst hit and why?

One way to identify future casualties is to look at the characteristics of past victims. Back in 2013 Indonesia was one of an unfortunate group of emerging markets dubbed the “fragile five” by James Lord of Morgan Stanley, a bank. The group, which also included Brazil, India, South Africa and Turkey, were all struggling with inflationary pressure, an overvalued exchange rate and a conspicuous current-account deficit (which measures a country’s trade deficit among other things). A few months into the tantrum Indonesia reported that its deficit had increased to 4.4% of GDP . The “market went into shock”, Mr Basri recalls.

Similar factors were combined into a “vulnerability index” by the Fed’s own economists in 2014. For the most part, the worse a country scored on the index, the more its currency fell in the taper tantrum. This kind of evidence has prompted Fed officials ever since to argue that the sensitivity of emerging markets to the Fed’s words and deeds depends a lot on economic fundamentals in the emerging markets themselves.

To the Fed’s critics, that can sound like blaming the victim. But it is also a hopeful message. It implies that emerging markets have some control of their own fates. They are not “purely passive objects of the effects of Fed policy decisions”, as Mr Bernanke put it in 2015. Mr Basri has recounted the numerous measures he and other policymakers introduced to make Indonesia less fragile. They narrowed the country’s current-account deficit by raising interest rates, tightening credit regulations and cutting fuel subsidies, despite the political damage that would ensue. Cabinet discussions were very “dynamic”, Mr Basri writes.

Indeed, judged by the criteria of 2013, emerging markets today look far less fragile than they once were. Inflation is lower (only 1.4% in Indonesia) and “exchange-rate valuations have cheapened up considerably”, says Mr Lord. Their current accounts are also “much improved”. Indonesia’s is now in surplus, as are India’s and South Africa’s.

These past indicators of fragility, however, may not be appropriate for 2021. The pandemic has depressed demand and curtailed imports, which has temporarily narrowed current-account deficits around the world. But the fight against covid-19 has also dramatically widened another kind of deficit: the gap between government spending and revenues. Budget deficits averaged over 10% of GDP across the fragile five last year, according to the IMF . Fiscal sustainability “has become the key macro area of concern for some emerging markets”, Mr Lord says.

Bond strategists at HSBC , a bank, published an alternative ranking of vulnerable emerging economies on March 2nd. The least resilient, according to their scorecard, are Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa. These economies have all been prone to current-account deficits in recent years, even if the pandemic has flattered the latest figures. And sizeable government debt in South Africa and especially Brazil leaves them exposed to any jump in interest rates, which are now unusually low.

The fairweather four

These are not the only potential sources of vulnerability. When American yields rise and the dollar strengthens, countries that have borrowed heavily in hard currencies find their debts harder to bear. But the trouble need not end there, according to Valentina Bruno of the American University in Washington, DC, and Hyun Song Shin of the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ). Any deterioration in the creditworthiness of one borrower in an international lender’s portfolio can limit the risks it is willing to take on other emerging markets, even those that mostly borrow in their own currency. Boris Hofmann and Taejin Park of the BIS have shown that a rising dollar is a particular danger to emerging markets that have sold a large share of their bonds to foreigners. One reason why Mexico is on HSBC ’s worry list and Turkey is not is that foreigners hold 46% of Mexico’s local-currency government bonds and less than 7% of Turkey’s.","['basri', 'south', 'emerging', 'mr', 'markets', 'exposed', 'treasury', 'tantrum', 'fragile', 'yields', 'deficit', 'indonesia']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
89,['The Economist'],"U SING A computer used to mean bashing away at a keyboard. Then it meant tapping on a touchscreen. Increasingly, it means simply speaking. Over 100m devices powered by Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant, rest on the world’s shelves. Apple’s offering, Siri, processes 25bn requests a month. By 2025 the market for such technology could be worth more than $27bn.

One group, though, has been left behind. The World Health Organisation counts 430m people as deaf or hard of hearing. Many use sign languages to communicate. If they cannot also use those languages to talk to computers, they risk being excluded from the digitisation that is taking over everyday life.

Many have tried to teach computers to understand sign language. There have been plenty of claims of breakthroughs in recent years, accompanied by so-called solutions ranging from haptic gloves that capture the wearer’s finger movements to software that detects distinct hand shapes. Many of these have won acclaim while alienating the very people for whom they are ostensibly designed. “The value for us basically is zero,” says Mark Wheatley, the executive director of the European Union of the Deaf ( EUD ).

It is easy to see why. Gloves are intrusive, as are similar technological solutions such as body-worn cameras. Both require users to adapt to the needs of hearing people. Hand-shape recognition, while useful, cannot by itself handle the full complexity of sign languages, which also rely on facial expressions and body movements. Some projects have been touted as offering cheap alternatives to human interpreters in places like hospitals, police stations or classrooms, where the cost of even small errors can be very high.

But things are improving. Research groups, which increasingly include deaf scientists, are asking how technology can best serve deaf people’s interests. Students of sign languages are compiling databases, known as corpora, full of examples of how the languages are used. Programmers are trying to turn them into useful products.

As with spoken languages, sign languages—of which the world has several hundred—possess their own grammars, idioms and dialects. Again like spoken languages, the hard-and-fast rules of grammar books do not really capture the subtleties of everyday usage. Single signs can be shorthand for complex ideas. Like speakers, signers often take shortcuts, such as representing two-handed signs with a single hand. They set up reference points within their signing space which can be vital for meaning. Correctly interpreting all this is much harder than recognising spoken syllables or written letters.

Generating data is tricky, too. Research led by a team at Microsoft, a big computing firm, and published in 2019, estimated that a typical publicly available corpus of a spoken language consists of around a billion words from as many as 1,000 different speakers. An equivalent data-set in a sign language might have fewer than 100,000 signs from just ten people. Besides large numbers, a good corpus also needs variety. This means conversations between native signers of diverse backgrounds, dialects and levels of fluency. Because deaf people more often have physical disabilities than do those with unaffected hearing, representing those with restricted fluency of movement is important.

Thomas Hanke, a researcher at the University of Hamburg, has, along with his colleagues, assembled a sign-language library containing about 560 hours of conversations, and which includes many dialects found in Germany. Originally, Dr Hanke asked participants in the project to travel to Hamburg. But while in the city, many volunteers started incorporating local signs into their communications. That skewed the data. Now, he says, he travels to his participants instead, and has been criss-crossing the country in a mobile studio for the best part of two years.

Collecting data, though, is the easy bit. Computers are slow learners, and must be told explicitly what each example means. That requires annotating everything—every movement, facial expression and subtlety of emphasis. This takes time, and lots of it. After eight years, Dr Hanke has only 50 hours of video which he is confident are annotated correctly.

Microsoft’s researchers are using crowdsourcing to improve the amount and quality of data available. Danielle Bragg and her colleagues at the firm’s campus in Massachusetts are developing a smartphone version of “Battleship”, a game in which each player tries to sink their opponent’s ships by indicating locations on a grid. In Dr Bragg’s version, each grid square is associated with specific signs. Players not only generate signing data of their own, but also confirm the meaning of signs made by their opponents.

Privacy is a particular concern, since collecting sign-language data requires recording participants’ faces rather than just their voices. When Dr Hanke tried to record people’s gestures anonymously, their idiosyncratic signing techniques were so distinctive they could still be identified. Dr Bragg plans to use facial filters, or to replace faces with artificially generated alternatives. That will interfere with the quality of the data, but she hopes that lower quality will be made up for by greater quantity.

If enough data can be gathered, researchers with a good understanding of deaf culture and machine learning can achieve impressive results. The 25-person team at SignAll, a Hungarian firm, includes three deaf people and claims to be one of the biggest in the field. The firm’s proprietary database contains 300,000 annotated videos of 100 users using over 3,000 signs from American Sign Language ( ASL ), one of the most widespread. It was collected with help from Gallaudet University in Washington, DC , the only university which caters specifically for deaf students.

SignAll‘s software can recognise ASL , though not yet at the speeds at which native signers communicate. Its current product, SignAll 1.0, can translate signs into written English, allowing a hearing interlocutor to respond with the help of speech-to-text software. But it relies on pointing three cameras at a signer wearing special motion-tracking gloves—a significant burden.

That may soon change. Zsolt Robotka, SignAll’s boss, says the firm hopes to offer a glove-free option. It is also putting the finishing touches to a product that works with a single camera on a smartphone. If that technology can be integrated into other apps, it could allow deaf people to use their phones to do things like searching for directions, or looking up the meanings of unknown signs, without needing to resort to the written form of a spoken language.

Crossing the valley

For the moment, Dr Robotka’s emphasis is on translating sign language into text or speech. Translating in the other direction poses greater difficulties, one being how to generate visual representations of sign language. The standard approach has been to use computer-generated avatars. But many fall into the “uncanny valley”, a concept from computer graphics in which artificial humans fall just short enough of verisimilitude that they instead look eerie and disturbing.

Bridging the valley would permit widespread two-way communication. Creating smartphone apps that can recognise a range of European sign languages, and translate back and forth between these and oral speech, is one aim of two new multinational academic consortia: the Sign ON project, and the Intelligent Automatic Sign Language Translation project, also known as EASIER . Both are working with the EUD , which represents 31 national associations across the continent.

Sign ON is targeting British, Dutch, Flemish, Irish and Spanish sign languages and, with the exception of Flemish, their hearing equivalents. Working with several European universities, it aims to solve three problems. One is to improve the machine-learning algorithms that recognise signs and their meaning. Another is to work out how best to interpret sign languages’ distinctive grammars. Finally, it will try to create better avatars. EASIER , of which Dr Hanke’s team at Hamburg is one of 14 partners, has similar goals: namely sign language recognition, robust two-way translation and avatar development.","['hanke', 'signs', 'computers', 'language', 'data', 'teach', 'deaf', 'languages', 'dr', 'sign', 'computing', 'hearing', 'race', 'spoken']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
90,['The Economist'],"F ACE-MASKS HELP reduce the spread of SARS - C o V -2, the virus that causes covid-19. Several studies have reported the more surprising finding that, even if wearers do become infected, their disease is usually milder. Now Joseph Courtney and Ad Bax, a pair of researchers at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, think they may have worked out why. As they report in the Biophysical Journal, it comes down to humidity, the immune system, and the protective powers of mucus.

At first glance, there may not seem much of a mystery to unravel. Masks cut the number of infectious particles entering the nose and mouth. One might expect, therefore, that severe disease would be less likely. But it is not so. One vital factor which predicts disease severity is how far viral particles make it into a person's lungs. Cheap cotton face-masks struggle to block the smallest aerosols, which are the most likely to penetrate deeply. Dr Courtney and Dr Bax wondered if something else might explain their protective effect.

One of the body’s first lines of defence against airborne pathogens is known as the “mucociliary clearance mechanism”. Sticky mucus in the nose and respiratory tract snares viruses and bacteria. Little hairs known as cilia push the mucus into the throat. From there it is swallowed and potent stomach acids destroy the invaders. But this mechanism relies on the relevant body parts staying moist.

That is harder in winter, for as air gets colder, its capacity to hold water falls. Lower humidity tends to dry out the respiratory tract. This is one reason why many upper-respiratory viruses, such as influenza, flourish in the winter.

Dr Courtney and Dr Bax speculated that masks may help keep things damp. They reasoned that, as a person exhales, water vapour would condense on the inside of a mask. Then, upon inhalation, dry air passing through the mask would collect the deposited water and bring it back into the respiratory tract and lungs. That could be handing a mask-wearer's immune system a significant advantage.

Keen to test their idea, the researchers checked several masks at 37°C, 22°C and 8°C. They breathed into a sealed box packed with sensitive instruments, and worked out humidity levels in their upper respiratory tracts. They found that, although all masks increased humidity levels to some extent, the heavy cotton mask did best of all. In the hottest room it boosted the relative humidity of inspired air by over 50%, compared with breathing without a mask. In the cold room, that number rose to 300%. (The other masks recorded figures of between 150% and 225%.) That suggests that, besides filtering out at least some of the viral particles floating about in the air, masks help keep a person's snot levels healthily high. ■","['tract', 'help', 'masks', 'levels', 'humidity', 'immune', 'water', 'hand', 'respiratory', 'particles', 'facemasks', 'system', 'mask', 'helpful', 'air']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
91,['The Economist'],"O FF THE coast of Formentera, an island in the Spanish Mediterranean, lives an organism that stretches 15km from one end to the other. Posidonia oceanica, more prosaically known as seagrass, spreads by sending shoots out beneath the sediment. Entire meadows, covering several hectares, can thus be made up of a single organism. The grasses are long-lived, too. The vast meadow in Formentera is thought to have been spreading for tens or hundreds of thousands of years.

But the seagrass is more than just a biological curiosity. Along with two other kinds of coastal ecosystem—mangrove swamps and tidal marshes—seagrass meadows are particularly good at taking carbon dioxide from the air and converting it into plant matter. That makes all three ecosystems important for efforts to control climate change.

This role was highlighted in a report published on March 2nd by UNESCO , an arm of the United Nations, on “blue carbon”—the sort captured by Earth’s oceanic and coastal ecosystems. In total around 33bn tonnes of carbon dioxide (about three-quarters of the world’s emissions in 2019) are locked away in the planet’s blue-carbon sinks. Research by Carlos Duarte, the report’s author and a marine ecologist at King Abdullah University in Saudi Arabia, has shown that one hectare of seagrass can soak up as much carbon dioxide each year as 15 hectares of rainforest.

All this is attracting interest in blue carbon from those keen to use natural processes, rather than human technologies such as direct-air capture, to suck greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. In 2018 Apple partnered with Conservation International, a charity, to protect 11,000 hectares of mangroves on the Colombian coast. The firm estimates the project could lock away around 1m tonnes of carbon.

One reason that blue-carbon ecosystems make such effective sinks is that submerged forests are denser than their land-based equivalents. They can also trap floating debris and organic matter, which settles on the sea floor and can double the amount of carbon stored away.

They posses another advantage, too. Unlike forests on land, blue-carbon ecosystems do not burn. Climate change is intensifying wildfires around the world. As forests burn, their carbon stocks are released back into the atmosphere. And fires can impede a forest’s ability to capture carbon even after they have burned out. In a study published on February 25th in Nature Ecology and Evolution,researchers at the University of Stanford found that repeated fires favour slow-growing tree species. These are better able to survive blazes, but they are also less effective at soaking up carbon than faster-growing species.

Submerged forests may be impervious to fires, but they remain vulnerable to other sorts of disasters. In May 2020 cyclone Amphan destroyed 1,200 square kilometres of mangrove forest on the border between Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. A marine heatwave in Australian waters in 2010 and 2011 damaged around one third of the world’s largest seagrass meadow, in Shark Bay. Over the next three years field studies showed that uprooted plants were releasing their carbon back into the atmosphere.

Fortunately, an older, man-made ecological disaster suggests that restoring damaged blue-carbon ecosystems is possible. During the Vietnam war, napalm and a cocktail of weaponised herbicides destroyed more than half of the mangroves in the Mekong delta. A report published in 2014 by the International Society for Mangrove Ecosystems showed that an intense post-war replanting programme was able to restore it within two decades.

And there is more to such ecosystems than simply acting as sponges for greenhouse gasses. They also serve as buffers for vulnerable shorelines, shielding them from storms that barrel in from the high seas. One study of 59 subtropical countries estimated that by dampening waves and providing natural barriers to storm surges, mangrove forests prevent more than $65bn in property damage each year, and help shelter more than 15 million people. Protecting and expanding them, then, appears to be a no-brainer. ■

92,['The Economist'],"W HEN IT comes to using artificial intelligence ( AI ), intelligence agencies have been at it longer than most. In the cold war America’s National Security Agency ( NSA ) and Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) explored early AI to help transcribe and translate the enormous volumes of Soviet phone-intercepts they began hoovering up in the 1960s and 1970s.

Yet the technology was immature. One former European intelligence officer says his service did not use automatic transcription or translation in Afghanistan in the 2000s, relying on native speakers instead. Now the spooks are hoping to do better. The trends that have made AI attractive for business in recent years—more data, better algorithms, and more processing power to make it all hum—are giving spy agencies big ideas, too.

On February 24th GCHQ published a paper on how AI might change its work. “Machine-assisted fact-checking” could help spot faked images, check disinformation against trusted sources and identify social-media bots that spread it. AI might block cyber-attacks by “analysing patterns of activity on networks and devices”, and fight organised crime by spotting suspicious chains of financial transactions.

Other, less well-resourced organisations have already shown what is possible. The Nuclear Threat Initiative, an American NGO , recently showed that applying machine learning to publicly available trade data could spot previously unknown companies and organisations suspected of involvement in the illicit trade in materials for nuclear weapons. But spy agencies are not restricted to publicly available data.

Some hope that, aided by their ability to snoop on private information, such modest applications could pave the way to an AI -fuelled juggernaut. “ AI will revolutionise the practice of intelligence,” gushed a report published on March 1st by America’s National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a high-powered study group co-chaired by Eric Schmidt, a former executive chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and Bob Work, a former deputy defence secretary.

The report does not lack ambition. It says that by 2030 America’s 17 or so spy agencies ought to have built a ""federated architecture of continually learning analytic engines"" capable of crunching everything from human intelligence to satellite imagery in order to to foresee looming threats. The commission points approvingly to the Pentagon’s response to covid-19, which integrated dozens of data sets to identify covid-19 hotspots and manage demand for supplies.

Yet what is possible in public health is not always so easy in national security. Western intelligence agencies must contend with laws governing how private data may be gathered and used. In its paper, GCHQ says that it will be mindful of systemic bias, such as whether voice-recognition software is more effective with some groups than others, and transparent about margins of error and uncertainty in its algorithms. American spies say, more vaguely, that they will respect “human dignity, rights, and freedoms”. These differences may need to be ironed out. One suggestion made by a recent task-force of former American spooks in a report published by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) in Washington was that the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance—America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand—create a shared cloud server on which to store data.

In any case, the constraints facing AI in intelligence are as much practical as ethical. Machine learning is good at spotting patterns—such as distinctive patterns of mobile-phone use—but poor at predicting individual behaviour. That is especially true when data are scarce, as in counter-terrorism. Predictive-policing models can crunch data from thousands of burglaries each year. Terrorist attacks are much rarer, and therefore harder to learn from.

That rarity creates another problem, familiar to medics pondering mass-screening programmes for rare diseases. Any predictive model will generate false positives, in which innocent people are flagged for investigation. Careful design can drive the false-positive rate down. But because the ""base rate"" is lower still—there are, mercifully, very few terrorists—even a well-designed system risks sending large numbers of spies off on wild-goose chases.","['spy', 'hopes', 'security', 'agencies', 'data', 'high', 'intelligence', 'published', 'learning', 'ai', 'report', 'machine', 'national']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
93,['The Economist'],"A MODERN CORRESPONDENT wanting to communicate privately can use computerised encryption. Three hundred years ago, origami would have been a better bet.

Before gummed envelopes became common in the 1800s, letters were posted with no security wrapper. Privacy-minded writers relied instead on cunning combinations of folds, tucks, slits and seals, a practice Jana Dambrogio at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has dubbed “letterlocking”.

Some, like the “chapel fold”, in which the letter is turned into its own envelope and sealed, were the equivalent of simple padlocks. Others were subtler. The “dagger trap” relied on a concealed wax seal that would leave a telltale rip once a letter had been opened.

But information about the practice is scarce. Most historical letters survive in their opened form, leaving aficionados like Ms Dambrogio with little to go on but crease-marks and tears. The few that remain unopened present a different problem: how to read them without permanently damaging the letterlock. Now, in research published in Nature Communications, Ms Dambrogio and her colleagues have come up with a solution.

The letters in question are part of the Brienne Collection, a trove of thousands of undelivered 17th-century letters bequeathed to posterity by Dutch postmasters. The collection includes 577 unopened, letterlocked missives. To get at their letters’ contents while preserving the integrity of the locks, the team turned to X -rays and computers.

The key lay in knowing that the inks used at the time often contained iron. This meant that an X -ray microtomography scanner, of the kind usually reserved for distinguishing teeth or bone from soft tissue, could reliably distinguish the metallic letters from the paper background. Once the scan had also revealed the topography of the sheet, with the location of folds and creases mapped, the resulting model could be virtually unfolded by a computer to reveal the hidden text.

Though some imperfections remain—a hole left by a burrowing worm, for example, or the dry scratch of an ink-free nib—the legibility of the scans rivalled anything one would find in a research library, says Dr Starza Smith, a researcher at King’s College London. And although no spectacular secrets have yet emerged from the Brienne Collection, the technique seems to hold plenty of promise for future research into a fascinating historical practice.","['17thcentury', 'research', 'collection', 'letters', 'reverse', 'security', 'dambrogio', 'ms', 'relied', 'unopened', 'trove', 'origami', 'turned', 'practice', 'cracking', 'x']",2021-03-03 00:00:00

The Code Breaker. By Walter Isaacson. Simon & Schuster; 560 pages; $35 and £30

W HAT THE transistor once was to electronics, so CRISPR gene-editing is to biotechnology today. It changes the field from something interesting but clunky, and of restricted application, into a game of infinite possibility that almost anyone can play. Transistors led to computer chips and the youthful entrepreneurs of the Homebrew Computer Club in Silicon Valley. Similarly, CRISPR editing has let a new generation of would-be billionaires explore ideas that range from systematising the search for the proteins targeted by drugs, to breeding pigs that might act as organ donors for transplants.

The transistor transformed the world; CRISPR may do that too. But it also offers a potential which transistors never did: that of transforming human beings themselves, by editing their genes. Those genes might be in body cells, in which case the changes would die with the person to whom they were made. Or they might be in germ cells, in which case they could be passed down the generations.

Henry Greely’s book is about the first known attempt to perform this more enduring trick, how it spectacularly backfired on the man who did it, and whether, and in what circumstances, anyone should ever try to do it again. Mr Greely is both a bioethicist and a lawyer at Stanford University, qualifications perfectly suited to his subject—the moment when germline editing went from being a topic of philosophical speculation to hard reality. That moment came on November 25th 2018, when He Jiankui, a researcher at the Southern University of Science and Technology, in Shenzhen, China, announced that he had taken it upon himself to edit the genomes of two embryonic human beings (later born as twin girls), and to do so at a point in their development when those changes would affect their germ cells.

As depicted in “ CRISPR People”, Dr He is less the villain portrayed elsewhere than a naive and tragic character who was completely out of his depth. Certainly, he was driven by a yen for fame and fortune. But he seems also to have had a genuine desire to do good. His stated aim was to protect the girls from the threat of AIDS by tweaking their genes for a protein which the responsible virus, HIV , uses to lock onto cells it is about to infect. Almost up to the time that he went public with his experiment, he seems to have expected a hero’s welcome. Instead, he ended up with a three-year prison sentence.

An inauspicious beginning, then, for the idea of human germline editing. But Mr Greely does not dismiss the possibility of future, better-conducted attempts to do it. As forensically as you would expect for an author of his background, he sets out the circumstances in which real need exists and no alternatives are available. Preventing HIV infection is not among them: it is easy to avoid and is treatable if avoidance fails. Mostly, his list consists of couples who carry dangerous mutations in combinations that mean they are bound to be passed on to a child unless its genes are edited. This will not be many couples. But it will be a few.

Attitudes to germline editing may change if it proves safe and effective in these edge cases, and as knowledge increases of how human genomes work. At that point the real debate—about whether to allow the technique to be used to end the genetic lottery of reproduction, and maybe even to enhance human capabilities beyond any now currently found—will become live. How scientific knowledge expands in this way is the ultimate subject of “The Code Breaker”.

Peering over the edge

Mr Greely’s book is a serious and scholarly work. Walter Isaacson’s, by contrast, is a page-turner. It weaves history and contemporary events into a narrative propelled by the career of its protagonist, Jennifer Doudna. In 2020 she was the joint winner with Emmanuelle Charpentier of the Nobel chemistry prize for—as the citation by Sweden’s Royal Academy of Sciences laconically puts it—“the development of a method for genome editing”.

Most people agree with the academy in recognising these two as CRISPR editing’s principal inventors—though they were assisted by many others and drew on the work of many more. There are, however, dissenters who want to share the kudos, and particularly the patents. Dr Doudna and Dr Charpentier worked with bacteria. A lot of CRISPR ’s applications will be in more complex creatures, such as human beings. And the researcher who first tried the technique on human cells was Feng Zhang of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Broad’s lawyers are thus battling with those of the University of California, Berkeley, where Dr Doudna works, and with Dr Charpentier’s representatives, over whose patent applications give rights to what.

“The Code Breaker” casts light on this dispute, as it does on many other inner workings of American science. For Mr Isaacson, previously editor of Time magazine and chairman of CNN , author of acclaimed biographies of Steve Jobs and Leonardo da Vinci and now a history professor at Tulane University, is an insider’s insider. His book glitters with the names of the scientific great and good. Eric Lander, until recently head of the Broad and Joe Biden’s choice for chief scientific adviser, often takes the stage. So does George Church, a brilliant eccentric at Harvard who hopes to revive mammoths and was Dr Zhang’s P h D supervisor.

There are guest appearances by (among many others) Francis Collins, who has astutely survived from one presidential administration to another as head of the National Institutes of Health; David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate who in 1975 helped organise the first scientific meeting to look at the ethics of genetic engineering; and Anthony Fauci, adviser on infectious diseases to seven presidents. The book offers a sympathetic assessment of a luminary who has fallen from grace—James Watson, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA and founding head of the Human Genome Project, who is no longer received in polite society after making some disgraceful remarks about race and intelligence.

Aside from Dr Doudna, however, the real star of the story is RNA . This is the neglected third member of life’s molecular trinity—the other two being DNA and proteins. Indeed, RNA probably predates those other two molecules and, crucially for current events, it forms the genetic material of many of the viruses that afflict human beings, including the one that causes covid-19. It is also the molecule which guides the CRISPR -editing complex to the right part of the genome to edit.

Mr Isaacson traces Dr Doudna’s career from its beginnings as a P h D student of Jack Szostak, another pillar of the scientific establishment and one of the proponents of the idea that the origin of RNA and the origin of life are intimately bound up. He follows the byways of her early studies on RNA enzymes, known as ribozymes, and her first introduction to CRISPR in its natural role as a bacterial defence against viruses. Later comes her fortuitous meeting with Dr Charpentier at a scientific conference in Puerto Rico. Fortune favours the prepared mind, and hers was well prepared to profit from what Dr Charpentier told her about her own work on CRISPR . But the meeting itself was serendipity.

Genes out of the bottle

In telling her tale, Mr Isaacson captures the scientific process well, including the role of chance. The hard graft at the bench, the flashes of inspiration, the importance of conferences as cauldrons of creativity, the rivalry, sometimes friendly, sometimes less so, and the sense of common purpose are all conveyed in his narrative. “The Code Breaker” describes a dance to the music of time with these things as its steps, which began with Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel and shows no sign of ending.","['books', 'university', 'rna', 'technology', 'tomorrows', 'work', 'dr', 'mr', 'human', 'explore', 'transform', 'humanity', 'scientific', 'world', 'isaacson', 'editing', 'crispr']",2021-03-03 00:00:00
95,['The Economist'],"This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends. By Nicole Perlroth. Bloomsbury; 528 pages; $21 and £14.99

I F YOU DISCOVER that a favourite vending-machine dispenses free chocolate when its buttons are pressed just so, what should you do? The virtuous option is to tell the manufacturer, so it can fix it. The temptation is to gorge. More lucrative still might be to sell the trick to others—including those with larger appetites and fewer scruples. But when the weaknesses of a system can be bought and sold, the results can be calamitous, as “This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends” shows.

Nicole Perlroth, a cyber-security correspondent for the New York Times, has produced an engaging and troubling account of “zero-day exploits”. An exploit is a piece of code that takes advantage of a vulnerability in software, typically to gain access or do harm. A zero-day exploit is rarer: it targets a hitherto undiscovered—and therefore undefended—blind spot.

Twenty years ago, exploits for Windows software yielded “pennies on the dollar”, a former hacker recalls. But as software became ubiquitous—running utilities, nuclear plants and warplanes—it grew more alluring. Zero-days became the “blood diamonds of the security trade”, says Ms Perlroth, fetching six or seven figures depending on their target and potency.

Such price signals worked as you would expect. Young men—in this story, there are few women—who once unearthed bugs for fun found a rich seam in governments eager to acquire and stockpile zero-days for use against their rivals. A high-minded hacker could choose to sell the fruits of his labour to defenders rather than attackers, as software companies began offering ever-larger “bug bounties”. Google even matched bounties that hackers donated to charity; one German whizz thus lavished funds on kindergartens in Togo, schools in Ethiopia and solar plants in Tanzania.

The trouble is that spiritual rewards tend to pale beside pecuniary ones. “If we wanted to volunteer, we’d help the homeless,” sneers Chaouki Bekrar, the French founder of Vupen, one of many brokers that bought exploits from hackers and sold them, at spiralling prices, to intelligence agencies. Many such brokers were veterans of America’s National Security Agency ( NSA ), who realised they could make far more money selling exploits to their old employers than churning them out in-house for a government wage.

Some of those former spooks insist that they will sell zero-days only to supposedly reputable clients, such as American spy agencies and police forces. But Ms Perlroth paints a picture of a global market in which deep-pocketed autocrats can snap up exploits to use against foes and dissidents with little oversight. When French regulators revoked Vupen’s export licence, it simply upped sticks—to Washington, DC .

This secretive market is difficult to penetrate, but Ms Perlroth has dug deeper than most and chronicles her efforts wittily. Her focus is on America, the world’s pioneering and pre-eminent cyber-power, which, she persuasively argues, has tilted too far towards cyber-offence. She describes how the NSA sucked talent away from the defence-minded Department of Homeland Security: “It had always been more fun to be a pirate than to join the Coast Guard.” She is right that American spies, like most others, hoarded zero-days and backdoors in software for longer than is advisable, rather than disclosing them to technology companies, in the mistaken belief that rivals could not worm through the same holes. (Spoiler: they did, as Ben Buchanan described in “The Hacker and the State”, published last year.)

Yet Ms Perlroth lays too much blame at America’s door. Its willingness to pay top dollar for zero-days inflated their prices, but that does not mean it “spawned and sponsored” today’s market. The author herself vividly documents a flourishing business in Europe and Latin America, buoyed by customers from Singapore to Tajikistan. China and Russia buy hacking tools, and use them, not because America showed them how, but because they can. The trade in digital lock-picks has thrived not because America stimulated parts of it in the 1990s and 2000s, but because what is behind the locks has become pivotal to economies and societies everywhere. ■","['undermining', 'zero', 'security', 'bugs', 'perlroth', 'software', 'ms', 'sell', 'america', 'market', 'hour', 'cybersecurity', 'tell', 'zerodays', 'booming', 'exploits', 'trade']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
96,['The Economist'],"Klara and the Sun. By Kazuo Ishiguro. Knopf; 320 pages; $28. Faber £20

I N “THE BURIED GIANT” , published in 2015, an elderly couple make a perilous journey through a war-ravaged post-Arthurian Britain, a land mysteriously afflicted by widespread amnesia. Sir Kazuo Ishiguro’s slippery allegory about the aftermath of conflict, and the value of forgetting as well as remembering, confounded some critics. It was seen as a puzzling left-turn into fantasy—a tag the author rejected, prompting accusations that not only had he raided a downmarket genre, he had done so ungraciously.

These arguments fell away when Sir Kazuo, now 66, won the Nobel prize for literature in 2017 (he was knighted two years later). But they may resurface now that he has turned to science fiction—or rather turned back to it, following his boarding-school dystopia “Never Let Me Go” (2005), which contemplated human cloning. Set in an overheated, rigidly stratified America, “Klara and the Sun”, his first post-Nobel novel, is a coming-of-age tale in which sophisticated solar-powered androids—entirely human in appearance and known as AF s, or Artificial Friends—are purchased by wealthy parents as company for their offspring. These children are taught remotely via smartphones and are genetically modified, or “lifted”, in a potentially fatal procedure intended to guarantee future entry into an elite university.

One of the book’s pleasures is that it trusts the reader to infer such details. What makes the subtly sinister setting doubly strange is that it is refracted through the partial understanding of the narrator, an especially sensitive AF named Klara, who recounts her bittersweet experience serving a mysteriously ill teenager, Josie. In a distinctly unrobotic bout of magical thinking, she begs the sun—the source of her energy—to cure Josie, vowing in return to combat air pollution. Keeping her bargain requires a furtive and quixotic quest and help from Josie’s loyal friend, Rick. Unlike Josie, Rick has not been “lifted”, one of many points of slow-burn conflict.

Sir Kazuo’s characteristically unassuming style draws the reader into a richly layered plot. His speculative scenario of technological innovation is also a domestic satire on aspirational parenting. Philosophical questions of faith and mortality mix with storylines involving boy trouble and mother-daughter strife. Josie’s sickness is a metaphor for the pressures of a hot-housed adolescence, yet the story holds attention on its own terms, too.

The effect ultimately resembles a cross between “Never Let Me Go” and “The Remains of the Day” (1989), with Klara in the place of Stevens, the butler whose first-person narration provided a between-the-lines portrait of morality among the English upper crust in the interwar years. As a rebuke to the hyper-engineered society that created her, Klara’s paradoxically humane conduct lends the book a melancholy beauty. Her devotion to a form of true love may be artificial, but, tragically, it is more than her flesh-and-blood counterparts can offer one another. ■","['lifted', 'sir', 'ishiguros', 'rick', 'kazuo', 'klara', 'meditation', 'morality', 'human', 'mysteriously', 'josie', 'turned', 'rich', 'reader', 'let', 'love']",2021-03-06 00:00:00
97,['The Economist'],"T WO TELEVISION shows about Catherine II of Russia recently had their premiere. The first, “Catherine the Great”, a collaboration between Sky in Britain and HBO in America, was released in October 2019. Set in the aftermath of the empress’s overthrow of Peter III, her husband, in 1762 the series was an earnest costume drama starring a grande dame of British acting, Helen Mirren. It focused on Catherine’s consolidation of power and her relationship with Grigory Potemkin, with the occasional speech about the Enlightenment and the solemn nature of statecraft.

The other show, “The Great”, was first released on Hulu, a streaming service, last year. A riotous comedy adapted by Tony McNamara from his own play, “The Great” begins with a young Catherine (Elle Fanning) leaving Prussia to marry Peter (Nicholas Hoult). Her hopes for a refined romance are dashed when she meets her foolish, barbaric spouse, whose main priorities are smashing things and shagging the women at court. Aided by her sharp-tongued maid and a weaselly courtier, Catherine plots a coup.

Notionally based on the same material, the two productions diverge drastically in content and tone. The difference captures a trend in historical dramas; more than that, it indicates an evolution in attitudes towards history itself in the world of entertainment, and perhaps beyond.

Beginning with a formal recap of the historical record, “Catherine the Great” treats its subject with reverence. By contrast, characters in “The Great” swear and discuss sex obsessively. The emperor is a borderline psychopath and uninterested in governing. The facts are bent wildly. Peter is on the throne when Catherine arrives, whereas in reality they were married for 17 years before he was crowned. In the show he is the son of Peter the Great, a paternity that lends him a minor Oedipus complex; the actual Peter III was the German-born grandson of his illustrious namesake. Yet this fast-and-very-loose approach—advertised in the drama’s winking introduction as “an occasionally true story”—furthers an irreverent trend that has developed over several years.

In 2015 “Hamilton”, a hip-hop musical about the Founding Fathers, showed that telling a story from the past in a fresh way could reap rewards. “The Death of Stalin” (2017) satirised the power struggle after the despot’s demise; the actors spoke in British and American accents rather than affecting Russian ones. “The Favourite” (2018), written by Mr McNamara and Deborah Davis, depicted a love-triangle involving Queen Anne and two female courtiers in early 18th-century Britain. (Historians doubt the women were quite so intimate.) “Dickinson” (2019), created by Alena Smith, revisited the life of Emily Dickinson, a poet, in the run-up to America’s civil war. Its characters use modern slang; the soundtrack includes rap and pop.

In “The Great”, Catherine evinces the real empress’s intellectual curiosity and belief that she was born to rule. The factionalism and power-broking have a true-life nastiness. But unlike, say, “Hamilton”, which explained the constitutional convention of 1787 in rhyme, here history is less a subject than a scaffold, on which the story builds freely. Each of the writers “got asked to pick our favourite eight points from history”, says Gretel Vella, a member of the team. They would try to include these nuggets, but if it “didn’t work with where the characters in the story were going, then we kicked it out”.

That method has something in common with “Bridgerton”, a breaches-and-bonking drama about the marriage market of Regency England. In Netflix’s smash-hit, Queen Charlotte, the real-life consort of George III, appears as a minor character. In this telling she is mixed-race and uses her position to elevate people of colour to peerages. Julia Quinn, the author of the novels on which the show is based, says this tweak allows 21st-century audiences to “all have a little piece of the fairy-tale”. In “The Great”, too, the past is a playground, not a corset.

Beneath the high jinks is a very 21st-century sense that accurate knowledge of bygone lives is impossible and interpretations always subjective. If what survives for posterity is an incomplete and contested record, all writers must fill in gaps to craft a story. Today’s screenwriters acknowledge their inventions by inserting anachronisms that emphasise their modern perspective. The methods go beyond jarring profanities. By using a distorting fish-eye lens, Yorgos Lanthimos, director of “The Favourite”, drew attention to the film’s warped view of the court.

Them and us

As much as the eras in which they are set, the real subject, or target, of these productions is the costume drama of yore, with its pretence of verisimilitude and the claim to authoritative knowledge of the past that it implied. Think of the authentic Tudor gowns in “Elizabeth R”, starring Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth I. Maligned as it recently was for its own embellishments, even “The Crown” strives to mimic the texture of mid-20th-century life. “There is a culture in the UK of pretty stodgy classical costume drama,” says Ed Guiney, producer of “The Favourite”. The genre has typically had “a style that was very polite,” Mr McNamara adds. “That lends itself to the idea of being rethought and played with.”

Apart from the bawdiness and the zippy dialogue, one reason “The Great” and its like have proved compelling is that, like Shakespeare’s history plays, they cleverly use old tales to reflect on contemporary society. “Dickinson”, for example, devotes a lot of attention to fame and political polarisation. The poet and her times are meant as “a metaphor for looking at us”, says Ms Smith, the show’s creator. Mr McNamara considers “The Great” to be “more of a contemporary show than a period one”, in that it is “about a young woman trying to forge her own life, as much now as then”.

It may help that the scourge of covid-19 has seemed to shrink the gap between today’s world and that of previous centuries. “We’re now living in a time of death and plague and pestilence and war and things you associate with the past,” Mr Guiney says. Ultimately, he thinks, the analogy is encouraging. “There’s something kind of comforting and at the same time enlightening about going back to times in history where maybe people felt as vulnerable as we do now, and looking at how they navigated it and got through it. Because they did get through it.” ■","['subject', 'great', 'catherine', 'history', 'dramas', 'past', 'playground', 'mr', 'mcnamara', 'favourite', 'breed', 'drama', 'screen', 'peter', 'corset', 'ahistorical']",2021-03-06 00:00:00

99,['The Economist'],"S LOWLY, WITH infinite effort, the elderly black woman got out of the car. Helped by a friendly arm, she laboured up the steps to the terrace. But there, squaring her shoulders, lifting her chin, she shrugged her helpers off. She knew how to walk, and she could walk from here. Her aim was to get to the water fountain by the sheriff’s office, the one that said “White Only”. Step by dragging step, leaning on her cane, she pressed on. The white officers by the door let her pass; they could hardly obstruct an old woman. At the fountain she turned on the water, took a smallish sip, let it flow round her mouth to savour it. Then, with a cursory glance at the officers, she went slowly back.

To play this lead role in “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman”, in 1974, Cicely Tyson spent months preparing. The film required her to age from 19 to 110, when the fountain incident occurred. She herself was somewhere midway, 49, though her elfin body and taut skin might have made her half that. To delve inside the being of this ancient woman, once a slave, she put on blurring contact lenses and studied residents in nursing homes, noticing how their hands shook and their memories came and went. What she did not need to study was Miss Pittman’s defiance.

Of that she already had plenty. She showed it most memorably on the day in 1963 when she went into Shalimar’s barber shop in Harlem and asked to have her sleek bob cut away. For a while she had practised hairdressing herself, wielding her hot comb and pressing irons to straighten out those unkempt curls, as white people saw them. Now she would wear her hair natural. It happened to suit the latest part she was playing; but more than that, it showed her real self, and she felt beautiful. She kept that half-inch Afro for her TV role in “East Side/West Side”, the first main role for a black actress in a series, astonishing Americans because her character had a serious career, as a secretary, and was comfortable in her skin. She then retained that lean, proud look for years. Many activists marched, but her civil-rights statement was her face on stage and screen. Each time she chalked up a first—the first black woman to win an Emmy as a lead actress, for “Jane Pittman”, and the first to receive an honorary Oscar, in 2018—she considered it not just a chance to be dazzling in ruffles, silk or lace, but a victory for humankind.

Defiance came naturally, as a black woman in a world where black misery was largely ignored and black beauty dismissed. Consigned to a typing pool when she left school, she walked out, declaring that God did not intend her to bang on a typewriter for the rest of her life. In search of a modelling agency, a path that saw her face in Vogue as well as Ebony and Jet, she sent her photos all over New York, and did not care when her mother threw her out for it. Hired in a small way in the late 1950s for feature films and off-Broadway, she soon put her foot down. There were roles she approved of, and roles she would rather starve than take.

Those included all the parts, and they were few enough, customarily assigned to black actors. While the men were con-men, hustlers or drug addicts, the women were plump maids or prostitutes, Jezebels or Aunt Jemimas. Characters like these had no dimension, no complexities or professions or family life, as white characters did. They were cartoons, the insulting half-wit faces on tins of chewing tobacco or laundry bleach, when they should have been teachers and lawyers, doctors and politicians, mothers and fathers. They were never given their full, true humanity.

She especially longed to see black sisters portrayed as they really were: the strength of their race, the ones who held their families together when the men went off, for whatever reason. (She knew all about that, saving Miles Davis time after time when the jazzman broke up their relationship with the stench of his philandering and the horrors of his cocaine.) The role she treasured most came in “Sounder” in 1972, where she played the wife of a Louisianan sharecropper who, when her husband was imprisoned for stealing food, had to run the farm and raise the children alone. It won her a best-actress Oscar nomination. As Rebecca, wearing cornrows as she hoed the dry soil and pinned up washing, she thought of her own mother, her fierce mentor, who had also brought up her children largely single-handed. They were poor, moving from tenement to tenement in Harlem, but her mother always managed to whip up potatoes and salt pork for their meals, and to sew the wonderful organza dresses her daughters wore in church. From her she had inherited, as well as her “blessed assurance” of God’s guidance, her stiff, straight back.

One day, however, she had seen her mother in a line of black women waiting to be hired as maids. White people in cars drove slowly past, looking them over. America’s original sin of slavery seemed as sharp as ever. Even decades later racism still ran deep in the film and TV industries, despite the progress on the surface. In 1977 she appeared as the hero’s mother in “Roots”, a TV series that told the story of an African boy, Kunta Kinte, sold into slavery in the South. It made a huge splash for a time. But there were still few parts for black actors unless these were “written black”, shoehorned into some white cliché of what her people were. And they were still not considered automatically as leads, capable of carrying a film, or as actors of classic parts. She would have loved, herself, to play Ophelia. The role seemed closed to her. But where did anyone say Ophelia was white?

In 2013, fulfilling a long-standing dream, she played an originally white role, Mrs Carrie Watts, in “The Trip to Bountiful” on Broadway. It won her a Tony award. The story was of an old woman who insisted on seeing her childhood home before she died. As usual she steeped herself in the character, even going to “Mrs Carrie’s” part of Texas to scratch up the earth and smell it. Being ancient herself now, it was not hard to get the moves right. And in any case, for all her care with nuances, her characters had one trait they shared. Whatever their age, they stood tall, squared their shoulders, pressed onward. They kept their chins high. ■","['role', 'tv', 'parts', 'tyson', 'went', 'white', 'film', 'black', '28th', 'fountain', 'cicely', 'died', 'woman', 'mother', 'defiance', 'beauty']",2021-03-06 00:00:00

It can be daubed on the side of a church. Head online and the same number (+48 222 922 597) appears in people’s usernames.

In October Poland’s constitutional court struck down a law allowing abortion in cases of fetal abnormality. Of the 1,000 or so legal abortions in Poland per year before the ban, nearly all were in this category. Now, abortion is limited to cases of rape or to save a mother’s life. This fulfils a long-held dream of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party to clamp down on abortions. Activists responded by turning cities into a gonzo Yellow Pages. It also provided a burst of publicity for Abortion Without Borders, an alliance of organisations such as Kobiety w Sieci that help women who live in countries where abortion is restricted. After the Polish ban, traffic to the website shot up and calls poured in. Among the callers were angry priests, demanding to know who had plastered their church with the number of an abortion hotline.

Abortion laws within the EU are a patchwork. They range from relatively permissive in places such as the Netherlands to practically banned in Poland (and forbidden altogether in Malta). The bulk fall in between. There are no common rules. Normally, the EU steps in to harmonise law. On reproductive rights it has no competence. Given that the bloc ranges from the devout to the enthusiastically godless, EU officials would rather ignore the issue. Yet thanks to the free movement of people and goods—and the increasingly blurred distinction between European and domestic politics—the EU still makes it easier to obtain abortions within its territory, whether it tries to or not.

Consider how organisations such as Abortion Without Borders work. Activists in Poland offer only advice, which is perfectly legal. Groups based outside Poland will arrange the delivery of pills, book flights, arrange translators and pay for treatment. In one case, they even coughed up the deposit for a hire-car. In Poland these activities would leave them open to prosecution. In, say, the Netherlands, no one can touch them. Posting abortion pills into Poland requires beating the authorities. Crackdowns have been mounted in the past. “We found other ways,” says Dr Rebecca Gomperts, a campaigner for legal abortion. Thanks to the single market, sending a package from one part of the bloc to another requires no extra paperwork. It is easy for goods to slip through. If it is a game of whack-a-mole, the moles are winning.

Likewise, freedom of movement means that abortions available in one EU country are available to all EU citizens, provided they have the means to get there. Groups such as Abortion Without Borders make that possible by paying travel costs (and, during the pandemic, arranging covid-19 tests). Usually, the EU operates on the principle that a person or business should be treated roughly the same in any EU country. Without common rules, arbitrage comes into play: companies can move from states with tougher regulations to those with lighter ones. This is exactly what can happen, at least temporarily, when a Polish woman wants an abortion. She boards a train to where the rules won’t stop her.

Abortion law in Europe is, on the whole, liberalising. Ireland allowed abortion in 2018, as religious opposition faded and the law was routinely flouted by women who went to Britain for terminations. Availability varies between different European countries, however. Terminations beyond 12 weeks are tightly limited, with only a handful of countries offering them in most circumstances. (When Britain, which allows abortions with little restriction up to 24 weeks, left the bloc, the options were further reduced.) The upshot is that women head to wherever they can get what they want. Enter the waiting room in a Dutch clinic offering late-stage abortions and one will find women from across Europe.

Free to choose

To its critics, the EU is at best a poor defence against illiberalism and at worst an enabler of it. Under its watch, governments such as Poland’s have trampled on women’s rights, judicial independence and media freedom. Only this month independent media in Poland staged a blackout in protest at a punitive tax. Yet when it comes to abortion, the EU ’s guarantees of free movement for goods and people serve unwittingly to spread a different kind of freedom of choice.

EU membership has liberalising effects in other, less obvious ways. When the EU was haggling last summer over €1.8trn ($2.2trn) of funds to be distributed to countries over the next seven years, some governments demanded the right to claw back the money if countries such as Poland trampled on the rule of law. Polish ministers dismissed that as an ideological assault, a punishment for Poland doing things liberal EU members did not like, such as limiting abortion. Actually, the reason other EU countries wanted to punish countries that threaten the rule of law was that countries such as Poland have been threatening the rule of law.","['polish', 'eu', 'poland', 'number', 'countries', 'charlemagne', 'europes', 'abortion', 'women', 'law', 'w', 'abortions', 'network', 'underground']",2021-02-27 00:00:00
101,['The Economist'],"T HE MECHANICAL clatter of chairlifts and the bass beat of high-altitude bars are familiar soundtracks in an Alpine ski resort every winter. So the quiet of the mountains this season is startlingly strange. French ski resorts are instead alive to different sounds: children tobogganing, huskies pulling sledges, defiant enthusiasts trudging uphill on skis with skins. Late last year, when the French government decided to clamp down on covid-19 once more, it shut all uphill transport but kept resorts open. This means the French can still go skiing—but without lifts.

Some solutions are punishing. Ski touring, or uphill skiing, involves struggling up the slopes on foot, with grips attached to the bottom of the skis. The Alpine village of Saint-Martin-de-Belleville, part of the Trois Vallées ski domain north-east of Grenoble, has opened a couple of runs for those with the stamina to reach the top. But skiers have become a minority. Husky-sledding is fully booked. Kit for trekking on raquettes (snow shoes) has sold out. “Everything we had has been pre-booked and rented,” says the owner of a ski-hire shop in Saint-Martin. At an altitude of 2,000 metres, hardy tourists can even go ice-diving through a hole in a frozen lake.

The French ski for almost as many days in total every year as Americans, who are five times as numerous. With little prospect of lifts opening this season, and most neighbouring ski areas also shut, France’s 325 resorts have had to diversify. This may help them lure more non-skiers to the mountains in future. Meanwhile, those who usually make beds, serve drinks, maintain the lifts or teach ski school in the Alps are either furloughed or out of work. Foreign tourists are stuck at home.

Saint-Martin-de-Belleville’s tourist office says it has only 30% occupancy, less than half its normal rate in February. In the high-altitude French resorts, purpose-built for skiing and often charmless, the rate has dropped to 25%, says the National Association of Mayors of Mountain Resorts ( ANMSM ).

The government has unveiled a “mountain plan” costing €4bn ($4.8bn) to help keep people and businesses going. But the squeeze is being felt. Some small shops and firms usually earn two-fifths of their yearly income in February. Revenues across the ski industry may be half the €10bn expected in a normal year. Village town halls, which depend on their share of lift-pass or car-park income, fear for their budgets. “The mountain is an ecosystem,” says Joël Retailleau of the ANMSM. “It’s easy to just press a button and close the lifts, but it has knock-on effects, not only in the resorts, but down into the valleys. This affects hundreds of thousands of people.”

Local anger at the government’s decision may be vented in regional elections in June. Laurent Wauquiez, a Republican who is president of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, was the favourite even before the lifts were shut. Marine Le Pen’s nationalist party was lying second without even picking a candidate. The government is unlikely to reopen ski lifts before the season ends. If anything, as infection rates start to rise again, it may have to tighten up. Neighbouring Italy had planned to reopen ski resorts this month, but changed its mind.

Ski lifts transformed the poor mountain valleys of France into playgrounds for Europe’s rich, but also created glaring inequality. Locals now find themselves missing the tourists, even if the mountains are gloriously peaceful without them. ■

Germany required hairdressers to close before Christmas. During this long winter many mop-headed Germans immersed themselves in distinctly undignified self-cutting Instagram tutorials, or made hair-raising dashes to salons in Luxembourg. Others went underground. Frauke (not her real name), a Berlin-based stylist, has been visiting clients for a secret snip “on the down low”, albeit with precautions. Lockdown fatigue has set in, she reckons. When hairdressers first closed last spring, almost all her regulars cancelled. This time a good 80% of them are willing to risk fines to maintain a decent trim.

""Our profession has social relevance,"" argues Jörg Müller of the Central Association of the German Hairdressing Trade. Yet its special treatment has inspired snippy comments from owners of locked-down hotels, shops and restaurants. What explains it? A slick lobbying effort by Big Hair helped. Politicians cite ""personal hygiene"" and the needs of the elderly. Frauke says her clients think the ""old, white men"" who run the country have grown tired of looking scruffy.

Either way, Germany's hairdressers have timed their return well. The decline in covid-19 numbers has stalled, and vaccination is proceeding at the pace of a leisurely perm. That means the (presumably well-coiffed) state and national leaders who will meet on March 3rd may not be able to offer German citizens and businesses the easing of restrictions they crave. When it comes to leaving lockdown, there can be no short cuts.

121,[],"As it relates to the workplace, artificial intelligence (AI) has gotten a bad rap. Workers often view AI as an enemy designed to destroy jobs and decimate livelihoods. By looking at AI as more of a partner, however, companies and their employees can actually create more value.

Superteams: How to put AI in the group



According to Erica Volini, Global Human Capital Leader at Deloitte, combining people and machines can create “superteams” that work together to solve problems and gain insight. “It’s about putting AI into the group and it’s part of the evolving relationship between technology and people at work—going from expanding the work potential of an individual’s job to creating new approaches for those individuals to work together and create new possibilities,” she explains.

Through these superteams, companies can let humans focus on what they do best. So, instead of apprehensively focusing on how automation and AI technologies will change traditional business functions, adoption should be viewed in a different light. “What has not been discussed as often is how these game-changing technologies will evolve the workers’ mindset in evolving their skills to using technology as an augmented and collaborated strategy,” says Nitin Rakesh, CEO at Mphasis.

“As we stand on the threshold of preparing the 21st century workforce for a rapidly-changing enterprise, organisations are redesigning departments, adapting to this seismic shift, and preparing for an era of hyper-personalised needs and demands for customers.” Rakesh says disruptive changes in AI are leading to changes in the workplace. “It’s driving organisations to actively modernise jobs functions that create work environments where digital mindsets are embraced and upskilling becomes more habitual.”

Expanding the scope of AI



But are organisations ready to fully embrace AI in this capacity? Deloitte’s 2020 Human Capital Trends report found that only 12% of respondents said their organisations were primarily using AI to replace workers and 60% were using AI to assist workers.

This doesn’t mean that they’re fully embracing AI’s potential, however. “The way in which AI is being used to assist points to a bigger problem,” Volini says. That’s because over half of respondents said they were just using it to improve consistency and quality. To be clear, these are metrics that should always be improved upon.

Volini explains that limiting AI to this narrow scope is problematic. “It minimizes the impact AI can have when it’s part of the team,” she says. “Organisations have to look at AI as a way to provide insights that can improve the way humans do their jobs—that is how superteams will be formed and provide transformative value.”

Practical applications

One example of AI’s incredible potential can be found within healthcare. AI tools can accurately detect patient deterioration. “This allows health teams to be notified of clinical changes hours before a patient becomes critical,” says Matt Johnson, CEO of EarlySense. “By identifying these risks early, health staff can take preventative action to mitigate the risk of an adverse event, such as code blue events that can result from cardiac or respiratory arrest, preventable ICU transfers ... and hospital readmissions.”

AI and machine learning are also being used to analyse electronic health records (EHRs) to help medical professionals identify and intervene when early detection and prevention measures could make a significant difference. “By leveraging existing, ordinary data with precision and speed, these organisations are able to prioritise patients that may show risk for conditions like lower GI and colorectal disorders, diabetes, lung cancer, flu and even COVID-19 complications,” explains Dr. Jeremy Orr, CEO of Medial EarlySign. This can help to improve patient outcomes, but he says it can also alleviate the human and financial costs of disease.

AI can be incorporated into other areas as well. “Utilities companies are using AI, along with remote sensing and data analytics to manage infrastructure,” Volini says. “Chatbots are being used in various industries not only to deliver rote responses, but in companies like HubSpot, they’re also being used to qualify leads before connecting potential customers to a human salesperson.”

These are just some of the ways that AI can work with teams if companies are willing to view AI as a way to help humans do their jobs. “Organisations that build workforce security through reinvention will be those that are well-positioned to capitalise on AI’s potential to drive enterprise value and create meaningful work,” she concludes.

122,[],"Change is the one constant in business and in life. Leaders often embrace change as a way to improve organisational efficiency and streamline processes. Sometimes, companies want to create a new and better vision that will attract new customers and energise and engage employees. And in other instances—as is the case with a global pandemic—change is thrust upon organisations, and failing to quickly adapt can lead to an untimely demise.

Regardless of the impetus, it’s often difficult for companies to successfully navigate change. Below are three tips for leading your team through unprecedented change.

1. Develop the right focus

One mistake that leaders make during change projects is engaging in strategic planning instead of strategic management. “It’s critical that leaders not confuse having a strategic plan with having the right focus,” warns Michael Canic, PhD, president of Making Strategy Happen, and author of “Ruthless Consistency: How Committed Leaders Execute Strategy, Implement Change, and Build Organizations That Win.”

He says the right focus is sustained—not bogged down and sidetracked by the company’s day-to-day demands. “You develop and sustain the right focus through strategic management, a continual and cyclical process of assessment, planning, execution and evaluation.” And Canic notes that the top management team must actively manage the process. “Strategic management emphasizes the mechanisms and discipline of execution as much as it does assessment and planning.”

Most people don’t naturally embrace change, and companies need to keep this in mind as it relates to their employees. “Company leaders must not only instill a sense of calm; they ought to be very clear on the team’s direction,” says Dan Pontefract, founder and CEO of The Pontefract Group and author of “Lead. Care. Win.” He warns against too many actions or an overabundance of prospective options or ideas, which can muddy the waters and result in confusion. “In times of change, a team’s focus becomes crystalised once the leader recognises simplicity and reinforcement are the organisation’s greatest assets—and it is how to weather the change storm.”

How do you ensure that change is handled as a process instead of an event, and that it’s continual instead of periodic? Robert Rosenberg, former CEO of Dunkin’ Donuts and author of “Around the Corner to Around the World: A Dozen Lessons I Learned Running Dunkin’ Donuts,” explains how that company handled change. “We constantly revisited our purpose as a business, and we translated our assessments into a common language: what did we wish to be (our mission)?” he says. “What did we wish to have (the two to four quantitative goals that most reflected success)? And, finally, what four to five strategic levers would we pull to bridge ever-scarce resources to achieve our objectives?”

2. Create the right environment

The next key to successfully creating change management is to ensure that everything in your environment is consistent with the organisation’s goals and purpose. “Few things demotivate people more than leaders who send mixed messages, who say one thing but do another,” Canic explains. He provides a few examples of how organisations send mixed messages:

Trumpeting excellence, yet tolerating poor performance

Giving people skills, but without the authority to apply them

Conveying expectations, but not the resources to fulfill them

Mixed messages, Canic says, can also “kill leaders’ credibility and undermine performance.”

So, how can leaders create the right environment? Canic explains that leaders must do five things:

Align people’s hearts and minds with the overarching purpose and goals of the organisation. Equip them with the necessary skills, resources and authority to succeed. Coach them by regularly providing feedback, guidance, reinforcement and, when necessary, constructive accountability. Support them with the required processes, policies and infrastructure. Value them as individuals, connecting at a human level by demonstrating respect, trust and caring.

If there’s a misalignment in any one of these areas, he says it can lead to failure. And that’s why it’s so important to create the right type of company culture. But, as with everything else, the culture starts at the top. “All organisations, be they countries, communities, companies or even families, reflect the culture and plans of the leadership,” Rosenberg explains. “The character, style and policy choices of the leader play a pivotal role in shaping the culture of an entity.”

The importance of good leaders is even more important when leading a change project during the pandemic. “A leader has the utmost responsibility to create conditions in which team members can feel psychologically and emotionally safe at work and highlight the light that awaits at the end of the tunnel,” Pontefract explains. Empathy is one trait that leaders need to exemplify. “Leaders ought to be asking questions to find out how employees are thinking, feeling and responding to the change.” This feedback can be used to fine-tune conditions that better support the team, which could include, for example, improving communication touchpoints, reducing meetings and tasks, or even giving the team more downtime.

3. Build the right team

The third step is to attract and retain the right team—but that doesn’t happen by selecting employees based solely on their skills and experience. “Every manager has been disappointed by employees who had the necessary skills and experience yet didn’t get the job done,” Canic says. Instead, he recommends looking at the candidate’s traits, since experience will tell you if a person has done the job, but traits will reveal if a person will do the job. “Traits to look for include being hard-working, driven to improve, inquisitive, collaborative and dealing well with adversity,” Canic explains. He recommends behavioural-based interviews in which candidates provide real-world examples demonstrating specific traits.

While skills and experience shouldn’t be the only criteria, they still count heavily. In fact, Rosenberg recommends being as rigorous as possible in defining the assignment. “The better the definition of the assignment, the more likely you are to find the right candidate to fill it.” Also, since all employees have strengths and weaknesses, his advice is to build on strengths. “To build a high-functioning team, look to the complementarity of the team rather than to find all things in all teammates.” And, of course, you should hire to fit the culture. “If the culture prizes teamwork, trustworthiness, winning and excellence, make sure the hire works best in that kind of environment,” Rosenberg says.

124,[],"Talk to the world’s most creative problem-solvers and they will often tell you that asking the right questions led them to discover their most valuable innovations and continues to fuel positive change in their companies today.

Take the social entrepreneur who created GoldieBlox, Debbie Sterling, who wondered, “Why are all the great building toys made for boys?” Or, consider Nobel laureate Richard Thaler, who questioned, “Would it change economic theory if we stopped pretending people were rational?” Marc Benioff launched Salesforce with a query, “Why are we still loading and upgrading software when we have the internet?” that created cloud-based software services. And Rod Drury, founder of Xero, routinely asks, “What is the exact opposite of what an incumbent would expect us to do?” to challenge the industry.

Great questions like these have a catalytic quality-that is, they dissolve barriers to creative thinking and channel the pursuit of solutions into new, accelerated pathways. Asking such questions is essential in today’s world where globalization, digitization, and disruption push leaders to the edge of uncertainty and force them to figure out what they don’t know they don’t know – before it’s too late. Decades ago Peter Drucker grasped this truth when wisely warning that the “important and difficult job is never to find the right answers, it is to find the right question. For there are few things as useless, if not dangerous, as the right answer to the wrong question.” This is especially true in our times of radical transformation.

In this live online program, Hal Gregersen and Roger Lehman deliver unique insights into the behaviors of extraordinary leaders and the unique conditions they created at work and in life to ask catalytic, game-changing questions. Course discussions and practical applications draw on interviews with several hundred business leaders during the past decade, including research studies conducted specifically for Gregersen’s newest book, Questions Are the Answer: A Breakthrough Approach to Your Most Vexing Problems at Work and in Life.

Through engaging discussion and active challenge-driven exercises, you will learn conceptual frameworks and behavioral habits for cultivating an inquiry-driven approach to leadership and life. These same methodologies will also help you overcome the natural challenges of isolation as a senior leader and help you uncover your greatest blindspots-what you don’t know you don’t know. Drawing from the successful approaches of companies like Amazon, ASOS, Patagonia, Pixar, and Zappos, you will learn how to create the special conditions for curiosity, inquiry, and “creative friction” to thrive and to fuel productive change in your organization. Come ready to make progress on a real challenge you face and leave prepared to lay the foundation for truly catalytic questions to fuel greater success at work, and perhaps in life.","['live', 'innovation', 'change', 'leaders', 'questions', 'work', 'problem', 'life', 'created', 'creative', 'dont', 'fuel', 'solving', 'know', 'breakthrough', 'online', 'right', 'approach']",2020-11-24 22:25:25-05:00

134,[],"Let us start with one of the school’s most important assets: its entrepreneurial and motivated student body! In February 2013, the school had the honour to welcome Herman Van Rompuy, the President of the European Council, as the keynote speaker of the Solvay Business Game, the largest European on-site business game. It gathered 400 students from around the globe, and is fully organized by the students. This event is only one example, amongst many others, that illustrates the importance of having creative and entrepreneurial students in our institution.

But the secret formula of the school is actually more complex than that: it involves a strong focus on quantitative skills, a large number of practitioners sharing their expertise with the students, the will to exploit synergies between economics and management disciplines, high level research activities performed by our full-time faculty, a democratic governance involving all our stakeholders in decision-making, the access to great complementary assets provided by the other faculties of the Université libre de Bruxelles, and a permanent focus on quality improvement, internationalisation and innovation.

Two new double degrees with universities in France and in China will allow selected students to spend one year abroad, and graduate with two official diplomas. With the newly created QTEM (Quantitative Techniques for Economics and Management) networked master, initiated by the school, students may carry out two exchange programmes over one year, in international high quality institutions. In order to attract more students from abroad, the school is currently launching a new series of postgraduate specialized masters. Our flagship master programmes now offer the option of completing up to six months of credited internship abroad.

Two new centres have been created over the past 6 months: iCite is a multidisciplinary research centre focusing on innovation, technology and education. The BES, Business Enterprise and Society Centre, aims at crystallizing further the interplay between private and public institutions on the one hand, and the school on the other.

In a nutshell, high quality stakeholders and a distinct orientation towards innovation and internationalization in our teaching and research services has led to the strong reputation and excellent performance of the Solvay Brussels School, as witnessed by its Financial Times rankings, its research rankings (REPEC) and its EQUIS accreditation.”

More than one hundred years ago, our founder Ernest Solvay, defined the school's mission as follows: “The mission of the Solvay Business School is to train men and women who are capable of selecting, initiating and managing.”

By and large, this mission has remained unchanged. But it has now been extended with the creation of the Solvay Brussels School of Economics & Management:

""We are the School of Economics and Management of the Université libre de Bruxelles, with a century-old tradition of excellence in higher education. Our mission is to have a decisive and positive impact on how economic and business challenges are addressed. We fulfill this mission by producing pioneering research and by educating women and men to become true leaders and entrepreneurs in their field.""

Vision: ""We strive to meet the most pressing economic and business challenges of our time with a unique blend of scientific rigour, contextual engagement and problem-solving skills. This will strengthen our position as a European reference for international students, practitioners and academics.""

Values:

1. Free inquiry: we challenge our students and stakeholders to open their minds to a wide range of perspectives

2. Excellence: we all strive to the highest standards of performance in our respective fields

3. Entrepreneurial spirit: we expect all our stakeholders to demonstrate initiative and leadership

4. Integration: we build on the multidisciplinarity of our university and our expertise in Economics and Management

5. Equal opportunity: we provide access to students from all socio-economic backgrounds

6. Democratic governance: practitioners, academics, researchers, students and staff all have a voice in our governance

7. Societal relevance: we nurture a long tradition of contributing expertise to public policy and the business world

When asked about Brussels, most people will likely tell you it is small. This is the paradox of Brussels in a nutshell. Triple capital of Europe, Belgium and the Flanders region, host to both NATO and the EU headquarters, European base for a large number of international corporations (more than a 1.000 from the United States only), welcoming home for a population of some 300.000 expats, incredibly cosmopolitan… Yet Brussels remains a very relaxed and laid-back town which manages to keep its human scale.

Ripe with all the facilities and entertainment you would expect from a capital city, from hotels, bars and restaurants to museums and famous monuments, Brussels is still easy to get around. Outside rush-hour you can cross the city in a mere 20 minutes. The city centre itself is easily walkable. And the green spaces (parks - woods - forest) account for 13.8% of its surface.","['stakeholders', 'european', 'business', 'management', 'students', 'economics', 'school', 'solvay', 'mission', 'research', 'brussels']",2015-05-20 12:01:54-04:00

141,[],"Buy or lease is an important corporate decision that financial managers have to make when they acquire an asset. The lessee saves the cost of purchasing the asset. In return, the lessee commits to a series of lease payments that are generally tax-deductible. The lessee thereby gives up the depreciation tax shields and any other tax credit associated with ownership, forgoes the interest tax shields that come from any debt financing, and loses the salvage or residual value of the asset. This module provides detailed analysis of lease versus purchase decision derived from a general Net Present Value (NPV) framework, also known as the “net advantage of leasing” (NAL). The analysis considers purchase price, lease payments, depreciation, interest expenses, operating cost savings, residual value, Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), and other factors that are involved in the buy or lease decision process.

The latest culprit was Bill Michael, the British chairman of KPMG , a big consultancy. In a virtual meeting Mr Michael dismissed staff concerns about the pandemic, saying that “you can’t play the role of victim unless you’re sick. I hope you’re not sick and you’re not ill and if you’re not take control of your life. Don’t sit there and moan about it, quite frankly.” Then he waded into the issues of racism and sexism by adding, “There is no such thing as unconscious bias. I don’t buy it. Because after every single unconscious-bias training that’s ever been done, nothing’s ever improved.”

It is possible to put a charitable interpretation on Mr Michael’s remarks. He was hospitalised with covid-19 himself and his definition of sickness may have included mental illness and depression. Those KPMG employees who have been spared illness are probably in a much better position than many other groups of workers. And he may have been arguing that examples of “unconscious bias” are really cases of very conscious prejudice. He followed up by saying: “Unless you care, you actually won’t change.”

But if he was going to make those points, he needed to do so in a more thoughtful and sophisticated manner. He resigned within days, as details of the call were leaked to the media.

Statements to outsiders can be as damaging as those to insiders. Perhaps the most calamitous in recent corporate history were Tony Hayward’s. Then chief executive of BP , an oil giant, he spoke on television in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy, when 11 workers died and much pollution spread in the Gulf of Mexico. “There is no one who wants this thing over more than I do. You know, I’d like my life back,” he said. The insensitive tone worsened BP ’s deteriorating reputation and Mr Hayward was soon gone.

Executives who depart from blandness to express an opinion put their careers at risk. They enjoy little upside and risk plenty of downside. If the executive is the founder, or the business is well-run, they may be spared. It helps if you apologise quickly. John Mackey, chief executive of Whole Foods, an American grocer, dubbed Barack Obama’s health-care reforms “fascist” in 2013 but quickly said he regretted his remarks. He is still in his job.

For Mr Michael, the real killer was the way that his views appeared to insult his staff. Given that KPMG is, above all, a people business, this was a fatal mistake. The modern CEO has to behave more like a cheerleader than a sergeant-major, bucking up their troops rather than berating them. Corporate culture is a slippery concept but if the boss addresses the staff as if they are idiots, the firm is unlikely to prosper.

By the same token, executives should be careful about the stands they take on political issues. When they cause offence, the ramifications can be widespread. Employees want to be proud of the companies they work for, and do not want to struggle to defend their job to their spouses, children or people they meet at Zoom drinks. Some will dub this “political correctness”. In reality it is common sense. Most modern businesses will have many female employees and staff from a variety of ethnic origins. The same is true of their customers. Upsetting the sensibilities of either group is not a sensible strategy.

One thing that the utterances of Messrs Michael and Hayward had in common was that they seemed to be off-the-cuff. Arguably, Mr Hayward had more excuse for misspeaking; he was dealing with wall-to-wall media coverage in the middle of a stressful crisis. Mr Michael appeared to be extemporising in the middle of a long speech. The reverse of Nike’s slogan ought to apply here: just don’t do it. The danger is that top executives are often treated with such reverence by colleagues that they get an inflated view of their own wisdom. Their opinion on non-business matters is worth no more than anyone else’s.

That does not mean executives have to speak entirely in platitudes. There is nothing wrong with having strong opinions about things that are relevant to the business. Warren Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders shows how to combine shrewd observations with humour. But managers should leave the philosophical and political musings to people who stand for election.","['bartleby', 'executives', 'michael', 'staff', 'political', 'hayward', 'mr', 'kpmg', 'employees', 'misspeak', 'youre', 'thing']",2021-02-27 00:00:00

Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Netflix are not literally bywords for, respectively, online shopping, smartphones, office software and video-streaming—but they might as well be.

To tech’s critics, these definitional regularities point to something insidious, encapsulating in a word the dominance that each firm wields over its digital fief—some of it possibly ill-gotten. In December American trustbusters sued Facebook for alleged anticompetitive behaviour, and Chinese ones launched an investigation into Alibaba. The central plank of one of three antitrust cases against Google is an agreement under which it pays Apple between $8bn and $12bn a year—about a fifth of Apple’s global profits—for its search engine to appear as the default on Apple devices. Google also allegedly offered Facebook a sweetheart deal not to support a rival ad system backed by news publishers.

Efforts to sever the linguistic links are multiplying. Epic Games, a video-game company that claims Apple is fleecing developers of apps in its App Store, has lodged complaints against it in America and Europe. On February 22nd Britain’s competition watchdog warned of looming antitrust actions against big tech. The European Union is working on regulations to check the firms’ power. Australia has just passed a law that would force them to pay publishers more for news displayed alongside search results or social-media feeds.

From the outside, then, the industry leaves an impression of a cosy club, whose members stay out of each other’s way—or worse, help one another perpetuate their monopolies. And the giants are only becoming more powerful. Last year the world’s ten biggest digital firms by market value raked in net profits of $261bn, as people depended on them for socially distant work, play, shopping and socialising. Their combined market capitalisation swelled by $3.9trn—more than the entire British stockmarket’s worth—implying that investors expect them to gain further clout.

Big tech sees things differently. Alibaba, Apple, Google and Facebook say their various arrangements are perfectly legitimate. The American firms co-operate, it is true, but only in order to ensure interoperability between their products. In fact, all tech titans insist, their relationships are for the most part not chummy but fiercely combative. Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, puts the balance of competition versus co-operation at “80:20” in favour of rivalry. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, recently called Apple “one of our biggest competitors”. “We feel like every day we wake up, we are under incredible competitive pressure,” says Apple.

In recent weeks big tech has certainly seen more barbs than bonhomie. Facebook has run ads attacking Apple over new iPhone privacy settings that would ask users if they wanted to opt out of being tracked across other firms’ apps and websites—which, in Facebook’s telling, would hurt small businesses that need it to reach customers (see article). For his part Tim Cook, Apple's boss, has been hinting that Facebook is playing fast and loose with users’ data.

On February 22nd Microsoft teamed up with European news publishers to develop a system similar to the one Google and Facebook had objected to in Australia. When this month Microsoft first expressed support for the Australian scheme, Google shot back that “of course [Microsoft would] be eager to impose an unworkable levy on a rival and increase their market share,” referring to Microsoft’s Bing search engine.

The fighting talk reflects a growing sense within the technology industry that incumbents are under assault. Though dominant firms remain powerful, and occasionally collegial, in one digital market after another challengers are gaining ground. Old-industry champions are at last getting their digital act together, as Walmart is doing in online retail and Disney in streaming. Less-big tech, such as Shopify in e-commerce or Salesforce in the cloud and business software, is also in encroachment mode. A flood of capital pouring into startups could easily translate into even more competition. Most significantly, tech’s mightiest titans are increasingly stomping on each other’s turf.

A defining moment

On this view, the era of winner-takes-all land grabs is fading, as tech enters a new, more competitive phase. If so, the industry’s lexicon may be about to get considerably more complicated.

The shift is furthest along in China. Its two biggest digital groups, Alibaba and Tencent, already compete with each other—and with up-and-coming rivals—across a variety of markets. Alibaba’s share of Chinese e-commerce peaked in 2013 at 62%, according to CLSA , a broker. Last year it was 51% (see chart 1). Once-fragmented competition is consolidating. The next two biggest firms, Pinduoduo and JD .com, an e-emporium backed by Tencent, have captured 24% of the market between them. They could reach 33% by 2026, reckons CLSA . Tencent’s WeChat Pay and Alibaba’s Alipay have long vied to be Chinese shoppers’ digital wallets. Last year Tencent announced it will invest 500bn yuan ($70bn) over five years, a slug of it to catch up with Alibaba in cloud computing.

America’s tech landscape is beginning to change, too. The Economist has looked at 11 big technology markets in America which last year generated combined gross revenue of $1.6trn. According to our calculations, which inevitably involved some guesswork, over the past five years the top firm’s share has plateaued in app stores, business software, cloud computing and online advertising. It has fallen by double digits in food delivery, ride-hailing and video-streaming since 2015. In most markets, even where the incumbent’s share edged up, as it has in e-commerce and smartphones, the aggregate share of the next two biggest challengers rose faster (see chart 2). In six of the 11 areas the two runners-up now account for a third or more of the market, up from two areas in 2016. Stragglers outside the top three are being left in the dust.

Some of the up-and-comers hail from beyond big tech’s homes in Silicon Valley and Seattle. Disney’s new streaming service has signed up 95m subscribers globally since its launch in late 2019, reaching that number nearly ten times faster than Netflix did. Walmart’s years of investment in online fulfilment began to pay off in the pandemic. Other bricks-and-mortar retailers such as Best Buy, Home Depot and Target have also upped their digital game. Shopify, a 14-year-old Canadian firm, now controls a tenth of the American e-commerce market, up from one-70th in 2015. Its market capitalisation has risen seven-fold in the past two years, to $150bn.

Perhaps the most salient feature of the new grammar of competition is the growing overlap between America’s five tech behemoths. Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are beginning to echo, on an even grander scale, the rivalry between Alibaba and Tencent. James Anderson of Baillie Gifford, a large asset manager that invests in tech firms around the world, does not yet see the “fight-it-out-on-the-beaches spirit” of the Chinese titans. But as Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, a broker, puts it, in a nod to the Boolean algebra that underpins modern computing, big tech is moving from the disjunctive world of “or” to the conjunctive world of “and”.

To be sure, the companies have an interest in ensuring their systems work seamlessly together. Demand for iPhones is encouraged by consumers’ desire to access Google’s search engine and Gmail, or Facebook’s social networks. Cheap cloud computing provided by Amazon translates into more apps for Apple’s App Store. Amazon is one of Google’s biggest advertisers. Microsoft licenses Android for its Surface Duo smartphone.

The quintet’s senior executives and cleverest clogs also know and, recent sniping notwithstanding, mostly respect each other. When Satya Nadella took over as Microsoft’s chief executive in 2014, he binned a pro-privacy ad campaign alleging that Google scanned emails to serve targeted adverts. According to Microsoft insiders his friendships among Google engineers probably played a role in his decision. Mr Nadella also decided to stop trying to out-Google Google in search.

The etymology of competition

A lot of earlier incursions big tech firms made against each other ended in tears. In the early 2010s all the big companies tried getting into device-making; remember Amazon’s Fire Phone? Microsoft’s Zune music player was no iPod and Bing is no verb. Many iPhone users navigate with Google Maps, not Apple’s unloved alternative. Facebook Gifts, the social network’s early foray into e-commerce, proved about as welcome as yet another pair of socks.

Indeed, the five American giants continue to derive the bulk of their revenues and, for the most part, profits from the businesses which made them into trillion- or near-trillion-dollar companies. Last year online ads generated 80% of sales at Alphabet and 98% at Facebook. Fully 80% of Apple’s revenues in 2020 came courtesy of its sleek devices (chiefly iPhones). Microsoft continues to rely on business software for a large chunk of revenues, and Amazon on its online emporium, though most of its (comparatively meagre) profits were generated by its cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services ( AWS ).

However, these figures used to be higher. With the number of first-time iPhone buyers declining, Apple has reduced its reliance on iPhones, iPads and Mac computers by moving into payments, finance and entertainment. The proportion of total revenue from services, at 20%, is double the share five years ago. Some of them, such as video- or music-streaming, compete with Amazon Prime Video and Prime Music, as well as with dedicated providers such as Netflix and Disney (for video) or Spotify (for audio). Amazon’s revenue share from e-commerce has declined from 87% in 2015 to 72%; a tenth of sales now comes from the cloud and 6% from digital advertising. The proportion that Alphabet got from advertising last year was ten percentage points lower than it was in 2015.

Those percentage points relinquished by the core are instead coming from an ever wider array of new ventures. Many involve the big five getting in each other’s way. Nearly two-fifths of their revenues now come from areas where their businesses overlap, up from a fifth in 2015 (see chart 3). If you split tech into 20 or so business areas, from smartphones and smart speakers to messaging and videoconferencing, each giant is present in most of them, according to Bernstein.

Many of these endeavours have yet to make much money. But the giants’ stratospheric stockmarket valuations—of between 25 and 82 times annual earnings—require ambitious growth plans. As their main businesses mature and slow, they must seek fresh sources of growth somewhere else. With trustbusters on high alert, snapping up startup rivals—or otherwise neutralising them—is getting harder, says a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. “Growth might depend on competing through homegrown efforts in known big markets.” The mutual toe-treading that ensues takes several forms. First, the companies are increasingly selling the same products or services. Second, they are providing similar products and services on the back of different business models, for example giving away things that a rival charges for (or vice versa, charging for a service that a competitor offers in exchange for user data sold to advertisers). Third, they are eyeing the same nascent markets, such as artificial intelligence ( AI ) or self-driving cars. Direct competition is fiercest in the cloud, a $63bn business expanding at an annual rate of 40%, which Wall Street expects to become a $1trn one within a decade or two. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s boss, once joked that Barnes & Noble understood within months it had to copy Amazon’s Kindle e-reader but it took his genius techie rivals years to twig they should ape AWS . They got there in the end. Microsoft’s 11-year-old Azure cloud-computing division rakes in an estimated $20bn a year in revenue. Bernstein expects cloud-computing to make up 12% of Google’s revenues by 2024, up from 7% in 2020. Acknowledging the unit’s importance, in January Google broke out the operating results of its cloud business (which lost $5.6bn in 2020).

E-commerce, which the pandemic has turbocharged, is another area being contested. Facebook has had a second-hand goods market called Marketplace for a while. In May it launched Facebook Shops to take Amazon on more directly, giving the 160m or so businesses which already use the social network or its sister app, Instagram, as a shop window a way to sell their products. Facebook and Google are also both working with Shopify, whose merchants flog theirs on their platforms. Even Microsoft is eyeing retail, albeit by a more circuitous route, with plans to sell automated checkout technology to Walmart.

Social media—Facebook’s bread and butter—are likewise in rivals’ sights. Last year Microsoft hoped to beef up its consumer business, which includes Surface tablets and the Xbox video-game console, by buying TikTok, a Chinese-owned short-video app. This year it considered acquiring Pinterest, a photo-sharing network. Neither deal came to pass, but it was a clear statement of Microsoft’s intent.

Amazon, too, “would be crazy” not to look at social media, says an executive close to it. In 2013 it bought Goodreads, a platform where people rate books and find recommendations, which has been described as “Facebook with books”. The millions who rate purchases on Amazon’s online-shopping platform constitute a germ of a possible future social network. A former Amazon executive wagers that “it will be easier for Amazon to go into social than for Facebook to move into shopping,” because the logistics of delivery, which Amazon has mastered, are trickier to bootstrap than a social network.

Then there is search. Microsoft, emboldened by its cloud success, could start investing more in the decent but marginal Bing. Amazon has concluded that if merchants on its e-commerce platform want to flaunt their wares to online shoppers, why let Google make all the money? Its search-ad business remains a fraction of Google’s. But these days most product searches begin in Amazon’s app or on its website.

Apple, too, harbours search ambitions. In 2018 it poached John Giannandrea, Google’s head of search and AI . People have noticed that Applebot, a web crawler, has become more active of late, presumably gobbling up data on which to train. Siri, Apple’s voice assistant, “is basically a search engine”, says one tech insider. Apple could, he adds, “skim the cream” by answering the most valuable queries—those by well-heeled iPhone users.

Unlike Amazon, which competes with Google head-on for advertising dollars, Apple seems unlikely to want to profit from search-advertising directly. Instead, its search project may be aimed at luring the privacy-conscious deeper into the safety of its “walled garden”—much to Mr Zuckerberg’s understandable chagrin.

This illustrates the second sort of competitive behaviour. Undermining Google’s or Facebook’s business model may not be the explicit aim of Mr Cook. It nevertheless forces his advertising-dependent opposite numbers, Mr Zuckerberg and Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai, to come up with services and product that would persuade users to respond “yes” to the tracking question.

Mr Pichai, for his part, is doing something similar by giving away all manner of products, from cloud-based word processors, spreadsheets and Hangouts video chat to TensorFlow, Alphabet’s machine-learning software, and Kubernetes, a cloud-computing project. Some observers see these giveaways, bankrolled by Google’s ad dollars, as an attempt to create a perfectly competitive profit desert that rivals have no incentive to enter—leaving Google with a Sahara’s worth of data.

Rather than electing to enter new technology niches, the companies are being dragged in, often by their users. As Amazon sees it, according to a former executive, the internet and copious amounts of data mean if you are in one business, you simply have to get into the one over the fence. E-commerce and social media offer a good example. “Social shopping”, where retailers organise mass virtual sprees for buyers on social media, are all the rage in China and may soon be in the West.

Thanks to customer bases in the hundreds of millions or billions, technology platforms can diversify easily and cheaply. Facebook’s Marketplace, for one, started after the company spotted large numbers of people buying and selling various things in Facebook groups, notes Javier Olivan, who oversees the company’s core products.

This process looks likely to intensify as the firms shift from looking over the others’ shoulders to gazing ahead. Often they end up staring in the same direction: towards data and AI . Four of the giants already offer digital assistants, which they would love to become consumers’ primary gateway to the internet. Everyone is also hungrily eyeing payments, especially in light of the recent success of PayPal, which has been gaining clout at the expense of Visa and Mastercard.

Big tech is pouring billions into ambitious AI projects. Apple has been in talks with several carmakers to build a self-driving car, which within the tech quintet has hitherto been the preserve of Waymo, an Alphabet subsidiary. Nothing has materialised but the idea of an Apple car is almost certainly here to stay. Last year Amazon bought Zoox, a self-driving startup. Alibaba and Baidu, a Chinese search engine, are also both interested in cars.

Not everything has improved. There is still scant competition in handsets. The two dominant mobile operating systems, Google’s Android and Apple’s i OS , remain a duopoly. So do their app stores. The online advertising market looks more competitive overall, but it is unclear if Amazon is really playing in the same sandbox as Google in search, or whether TikTok is a direct rival to Facebook in social media.

The tech giants have also become adept at playing the antitrust referees to keep potential competitors busy defending their core businesses from regulators, and thus less able to encroach on other markets. “Everyone is desperate to say it’s not me, it’s the guy over there,” says a tech executive. Microsoft got the antitrust ball rolling against Google in the late 2000s by building a coalition of companies against its dominance of search. Members of that coalition such as Yelp, a local search and reviewing site, are once again agitating against Google, leading insiders to chortle about how Microsoft “sleeper cells” have come to life.

Lina Khan of Columbia Law School, who was legal counsel for a congressional committee that investigated big tech, says that the giants are skirmishing in some areas, like the cloud and voice assistants. But still, she says, they are not battling over core territory, and, what is more, describing this as a fight risks overlooking the broader ways in which the firms mutually benefit from their collective dominance.

New coinage

If the skirmishes intensify, that could lead to lower profitability for the tech companies. Margins in cloud computing, where competition is most pronounced, are already tightening. According to Mr Anderson of Baillie Gifford, Google’s tilt at the AWS /Azure quasi-duopoly has pushed down prices. Tencent’s cloud investments are likely to add pressure.

Alphabet’s operating margins have declined by 13 percentage points over the past ten years. Even Apple’s are ten percentage points below their peak in 2012. Those of Facebook have come down from a lofty 50% in 2017 to less than 40%. The companies mostly keep mum about how their individual businesses are doing. But one possible explanation for slimmer overall margins is greater competition. Another is that entry into new markets eats into profits from core businesses. This could eventually put pressure on rivals also present in those markets.

The presumption that the tech giants are either colluding to divvy up the planet's digital pie or carefully steering clear of each other is no longer right. Many people would of course prefer to see more than a handful of firms slug it out for the modern economy’s critical digital markets. Still, so long as they truly are slugging it out, that is good news for everyone else. ■","['collusion', 'tech', 'competition', 'digital', 'technology', 'firms', 'microsoft', 'facebook', 'rules', 'amazon', 'apple', 'google', 'search', 'collisions', 'social', 'industry']",2021-02-27 00:00:00

In China anti-capitalist sentiment is growing online; overworked youth have a decidedly Maoist view of the country’s biggest businesses and tycoons. And the uphill struggles of France’s skiing industry. Runtime: 22min

158,['The Economist'],"OUTSIDE A POLLING station in El Salvador’s capital city Jennifer Vásquez, a 36-year-old selling water, explains why she voted for candidates from New Ideas, the party of the president, who is just a few years older than she is. “Nayib Bukele has done things no president has ever done before,” she gushes, dressed in a T-shirt the sky blue of Mr Bukele’s party. “We have received packages of food, including tuna and rice, and he is going to send computers to my children.”

Most voters in the country of 6.5m seem similarly smitten. New Ideas won in a landslide in the legislative and municipal elections on February 28th. The party, which was founded in 2018—too late for the previous general election—won at least 56 seats in the 84-seat assembly, giving it a two-thirds majority to pass laws—unprecedented in the post-war era.

The result has shattered El Salvador’s political duopoly. Two parties have dominated the country since the end of the civil war in 1992: Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), a left-wing party that grew out of guerrilla groups, and the Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), a conservative party that was founded by a former soldier to oppose those guerrillas. Now they have fewer than two dozen lawmakers between them.

The new kid on the block

At first glance Mr Bukele does not seem like a traditional caudillo. The 39-year-old, who was elected president in 2019, wears his baseball cap backwards and broadcasts his every passing thought on social media. An astute publicist, he has enthralled a populace sick of graft. (Three of the previous four presidents have been investigated for corruption; one is now in jail.)

Mr Bukele’s approval ratings, at around 90%, are higher than those of any other Latin American leader. Critics see in his ascendancy a danger to democracy. He controls two branches of the state: the legislature and the executive. His super-majority gives him a chance to shape the third: the legislative assembly must pick a new attorney-general and five Supreme Court judges this year.

Since he took power Mr Bukele has shown little regard for institutions. “He treats laws like we treat driving regulations,” says Nelson Rauda, a local journalist. In February last year, frustrated by lawmakers’ refusal to approve the budget for his security programme, Mr Bukele entered Congress with gun-toting soldiers. In April, after an uptick in the murder rate, his government forced hundreds of prisoners (mostly gang members) to huddle together with their hands tied behind their backs, naked apart from their underwear and flimsy face-masks. Mr Bukele tweeted the photo, unembarrassed by the risk that jam-packing prisoners might spread covid-19.

He has demonised anyone who opposes him, including businessmen, journalists and politicians; a fact some blame for the shooting of two FMLN activists in January, the worst act of political violence since the end of the civil war. And like other populist leaders, he foments distrust of democratic institutions. He warned, without evidence, of possible fraud, and just before the polls closed he broke electoral law by giving a press conference urging people to vote.

Those in power say the election result will mollify Mr Bukele (who, along with tweeting furiously about his detractors, keenly watches his approval ratings). Felix Ulloa, the vice-president, says the “resistance” of the bureaucracy and assembly “generated a confrontational attitude in him”. Others are more worried. “We will see how he governs once there are no obstacles,” says Alex Segovia, an economist and former FMLN official.

Mr Bukele has a lot to tackle. The World Health Organisation has praised El Salvador’s handling of covid-19—the government invested in hospitals and handed out money to ease the economic pain of the pandemic. However, it also imposed lockdown rules so harsh that the Supreme Court ruled some of them unconstitutional. And these measures contributed to an economic contraction of close to 9% in 2020, among the worst in the region. Public debt is around 90% of GDP. Crime, corruption and poverty remain entrenched.

Mr Bukele claims to have no ideology; he says he simply wants to get things done. But he has no plan, says Bertha Deleón, his former lawyer who cut contact with the president after his gun-toting antics in February. “Everything is pure publicity,” she says. His advisers are typically yes-men. Some are his brothers: one heads his party; another led his presidential campaign. His record so far is decidedly mixed.

Take corruption, which he has vowed to curb. Early in his term, he set up an independent anti-corruption body. But his government has produced no evidence of how it has spent the hundreds of millions of dollars it received from donors during the pandemic. When the anti-graft body sent to the attorney-general evidence suggesting mishandling of such aid, the government obstructed the investigations. In November the police, who like the army now seem loyal to Mr Bukele rather than the state, stopped agents from entering the health ministry to gather more evidence relating to procurement contracts, including those with companies owned by ministerial relatives.","['corruption', 'el', 'salvadors', 'populist', 'salvadoreans', 'president', 'evidence', 'party', 'mr', 'fmln', 'bukele', 'nayib', 'including', 'salvador', 'elections', 'love']",2021-03-02 00:00:00
159,['The Economist'],"F OR YEARS it made the powerful tremble. The revelations by the task-force of prosecutors in Curitiba who led the anti-corruption probe known as Lava Jato (Car Wash) brought millions of Brazilians onto the streets in outrage. Those protests contributed to the impeachment of a president, Dilma Rousseff, in 2016. The prosecutors secured jail sentences for her predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and Marcelo Odebrecht, Brazil’s ninth-richest man. On February 3rd the task-force was wound up, in near-silence. Its demise marks the symbolic end of an unprecedented push to reduce graft across Latin America. Sadly, there is little reason to think that it has made a lasting difference. The pandemic and the economic slump have displaced, probably temporarily, worries about crooks in suits.

Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.

Lava Jato started with a money-launderer who used a money-transfer service at a petrol station in Brasília (thus its name). Prosecutors uncovered a web of bribes for padded contracts issued by Petrobras, the state-controlled oil giant, over more than a decade in which Lula’s Workers’ Party was in power (see article). The task-force used new tools, including plea-bargaining and the exchange of financial information with Swiss and other authorities. They found that Odebrecht, a construction firm, had set up a bribes unit that paid $800m in a dozen countries. The malfeasance extended to other big Brazilian firms.

In all, 174 people, including 16 politicians, were found guilty, and 26bn reais ($5bn) was recovered for public coffers. Three former Peruvian presidents were detained over the Odebrecht scandal; a fourth committed suicide. In a region where the powerful enjoyed impunity, this was unprecedented.

Yet in the end the anti-corruption drive was undone by the politicisation of justice, in two ways. Sergio Moro, the crusading judge in Curitiba, turned out not to be impartial. He sentenced Lula to 12 years for receiving a beachside apartment. Except that Lula neither owned nor used it. That sentence was upheld by an appeal court. There were other, more solid cases against Lula. But with him out of the presidential race in 2018, Mr Moro became justice minister in the government of Jair Bolsonaro, its hard-right winner. Leaked messages showed that Mr Moro coached Deltan Dallagnol, the lead prosecutor in Curitiba, in violation of procedure.

As minister, Mr Moro said he hoped to institutionalise the fight against corruption. Mr Bolsonaro had posed as an anti-corruption campaigner. In office, he scotched that agenda after prosecutors began investigating one of his sons and an aide. Mr Bolsonaro’s hand-picked attorney-general weakened the task-force before winding it up. Four prosecutors will continue to work on corruption and Edson Fachin, the Supreme Court justice handling Lava Jato cases, insists it “has only just begun”. That smacks of bravado.

Lava Jato promised to cleanse Brazilian politics. “It could have been as important for Brazil as democratisation in the 1980s and the [inflation-busting] Real Plan of the 1990s,” says Eduardo Giannetti, a Brazilian philosopher. But there was no follow-up. In another sign of a return to the “old politics” that Mr Bolsonaro once denounced, he backed Arthur Lira, a defendant in Lava Jato, as the new speaker of the lower house of Congress.

Outside Brazil, Peru’s prosecutors went furthest. But they have yet to prove any of their cases. In targeting some people for investigation, they appear to have political motives. In Mexico Emilio Lozoya, a former boss of Pemex, the state energy company, is accused of pocketing $10.5m but walks free after incriminating political foes of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. In Argentina, there is some hope. On February 24th Lázaro Báez, a close associate of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the vice-president and a former president, was sentenced to 12 years for money-laundering. Attempts by Ms Fernández’s supporters to capture the judiciary have so far failed.

Lava Jato has shown that there are effective ways to take on grand corruption. “Some lessons have been learned,” says Delia Ferreira, an Argentine lawyer who chairs Transparency International, a global watchdog. Some big firms have tightened controls. But this progress has not been consolidated into greater judicial independence. There is no sadder example of the problem’s persistence than allegations in several countries of profiteering from the procurement of health-care supplies during the pandemic. In one of its biggest battles, Latin America is almost back to square one.","['moro', 'lula', 'anticorruption', 'sad', 'used', 'taskforce', 'bello', 'mr', 'president', 'quiet', 'death', 'brazils', 'prosecutors', 'jato', 'lava', 'odebrecht']",2021-02-27 00:00:00
160,['The Economist'],"N IXON BOUMBA used to take morning jogs through the prosperous Pacot neighbourhood in Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital. The area has steep, tree-lined streets and “gingerbread” houses. (These wooden-lattice structures, built in the early 1900s, survived a devastating earthquake in 2010.) But Mr Boumba does not jog any more. A surge of kidnappings and murders has kept him indoors (see chart). The gangs responsible for those crimes often have links to the police and politicians. The true number of attacks is probably far higher than the reported one. “We are living in a time of terror,” says Mr Boumba, a human-rights activist.

Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.

Terror has not stopped him from joining protests against President Jovenel Moïse. These have been going on for more than two years, provoked initially by economic hardship and allegations of corruption. Since January this year crime, and the fear that Mr Moïse is setting himself up as a dictator, have sparked a new wave. The protesters contend that his term ended on February 7th this year. They want his immediate departure.

Those making that demand are divided into two broad groups. They are as much at odds with each other as they are with the president. Pro-democracy idealists like Mr Boumba are mainly activists, professionals and young people. They have no political parties or elected officials. The established opposition is led by former office-holders. Some have been allies of Mr Moïse. They join the anti-Moïse agitation, but are regarded by the idealists as being just as corrupt as the regime. They seem interested only in taking power, says Rosy Auguste Ducena, a human-rights lawyer. Haiti’s hope lies with the new generation. But the three-way fight makes it harder to predict who will steer the country’s future.

Mr Moïse, a former plantation manager who calls himself “Banana Man”, exemplifies the failings of recent Haitian presidents and has added to them. Popular anger flared in 2017 after reports, which he denies, that he had stolen millions of dollars from PetroCaribe, an aid programme paid for by Venezuela. These allegations, plus fuel shortages and high inflation, provoked demonstrations in the following year. In 2019 a peyi lock (internal blockade) closed schools and businesses for months. This deepened a recession that had already started. Today 35% of Haitians are suffering acute hunger, according to the UN . In the pandemic’s first wave around 120,000 Haitians lost jobs in the neighbouring Dominican Republic, increasing the misery. Mr Moïse’s alleged use of violence against opponents and his flouting of democratic norms remind some people of “Baby Doc” Duvalier, Haiti’s last despot, who was overthrown in 1986. His foes accuse him of overseeing Haiti’s “gangsterisation”. Politicians have long had links to criminals, but Mr Moïse’s seem especially strong, his critics say. (He denies these claims.) In January Jimmy “Barbecue” Cherizier, a former police officer and leader of G 9 and Family, an alliance of gangs, led a march in defence of Mr Moïse. Last year the United States imposed sanctions on Mr Cherizier and on two senior officials in Mr Moïse’s administration for planning a massacre by police of at least 71 people in 2018 in La Saline, in Port-au-Prince. The motives are unclear. Many gangs are widely thought to have agreements with the government to silence opposition neighbourhoods in exchange for impunity. Mr Moïse disputes this, too. Within the government, it is Mr Moïse himself who enforces compliance. In the absence of a functioning legislature, he has been ruling by decree since January 2020. Legislative elections were not held on schedule because parliament failed to pass an election law during the peyi lock. Just ten members of the 30-seat Senate still hold electoral mandates and none of the lower house’s 119 seats is occupied. There are no serving mayors. In November Mr Moïse created an intelligence agency, answerable only to him, and widened the definition of terrorism to include acts of dissent. In February this year he forced three Supreme Court judges into early retirement and ordered the arrest of a score of his most prominent detractors, accusing them of plotting a coup.

Mr Moïse disputes the opposition’s claim that his term is already up. He took office in 2017, after a re-run of a flawed election held two years earlier. His five-year term thus expires next February, he reasons. His foes doubt he will leave office even then. In a referendum to be held in April, Mr Moïse plans to seek approval for amendments he wants to make to the constitution. These might include giving him the right to run for a second term. Under the constitution, a president cannot exercise powers that he introduces into it. Mr Moïse’s foes doubt that he will comply.

Beyond a shared desire to remove him from power, the two currents of opposition have little in common. Established opposition politicians are as bad as the president, activists say. Youri Latortue, a former senator who is one of the old opposition’s most prominent figures, was once described in an American diplomatic cable as one of the most “brazenly corrupt of leading politicians”. (He denies this characterisation.) Some opposition leaders are backed by anti-government gangs, which differ little from pro-government outfits.

The new opposition aspires to reinvent politics. “This is about starting something new, this is about respect of human rights, this is about organising fair and credible elections,” says Emmanuela Douyon, a leader of Nou Pap Dòmi (We Will Not Sleep), a social movement. She and her allies know that will require ending the political instability that began with Duvalier’s fall. Election results since then have nearly always been disputed by the loser. The opposition almost invariably demands the president’s resignation, says Michael Deibert, author of two books on Haiti. In 2016 less than 20% of eligible voters turned out in the election that Mr Moïse won. The constitution, adopted in 1987, has never commanded broad respect. A Creole saying holds that “constitutions are paper, but bayonets are steel”, says Robert Fatton of the University of Virginia. The opposition acknowledges the need for constitutional change, but does not want Mr Moïse leading it.

Civil-society groups are planning to hold a huge march on February 28th. After that, the route is uncertain. Most opposition forces want to install a transitional government as a prelude to holding free elections. But they disagree on how to do that. The old guard want a forcibly retired judge, Joseph Mécène Jean-Louis, to be interim president. Activist groups want someone outside the political elite in that job. That person may be in power for a while. The interim authority would need to take substantial time to prepare for credible elections, says Ms Douyon. Meanwhile, she hopes, new politicians will offer themselves as candidates, drawing new voters.

Unifying opposition groups behind a single proposal will be difficult. Obtaining Mr Moïse’s co-operation will be impossible. The United States, which is home to 1m Haitians whose remittances sustain Haiti’s economy, fears that his immediate removal would lead to chaos. On February 5th the State Department backed Mr Moïse’s claim that his term ends in 2022, a decision that outraged protesters, who remember with bitterness the United States’ repeated military interventions in Haiti. It is “putting their foot on the scales”, argues Brian Concannon, a long-time Haiti-watcher. Many Haitians, including some in the diaspora, suspect that the United States doubts that Haiti can handle democracy.

The activists confronting Mr Moïse hope to prove that view wrong. Haiti’s well-wishers are cautious. “Maybe we’ve reached the bottom, and the only way is up,” speculates Mr Fatton, who was born in Haiti. But he has thought that before. ■","['rid', 'moïse', 'jovenel', 'moïses', 'haitis', 'president', 'states', 'mr', 'hope', 'opposition', 'term', 'politicians', 'haiti', 'united', 'hoping']",2021-02-27 00:00:00
161,['The Economist'],"I N 2018 GENTE DE ZONA , a Cuban reggaeton band based in Miami, performed in Havana for 350,000 people. The duo’s front man, Alexander Delgado, encouraged them to clap for Cuba’s newly inaugurated president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, who was in the audience. Cuban-American musicians and politicians in Miami were furious.

Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.

Now it is Mr Díaz-Canel’s turn to fume. In a video released on February 16th, Gente de Zona join other famous reggaetoneros, rappers and hip-hop artists to perform “Patria y Vida” (“Homeland and Life”), which excoriates Cuba’s communist dictatorship and makes common cause with dissidents. Alongside Yotuel and Descemer Bueno, Grammy-winners who live outside Cuba but have strong links to it, Gente de Zona liken the 62 years since Cuba’s revolution to a game of dominoes—a popular pastime on the island—that is blocked, so no player can take a turn. The track’s title is a take-off of the revolutionary slogan “Patria o Muerte” (“Homeland or Death”), which appears on billboards and banknotes.

The performers, some shirtless and body-painted, sing about Cuba’s food shortages, families unable to see their relatives abroad and Cuba’s weak peso. Maykel Osorbo and El Funky, who belong to Movimiento San Isidro, a growing movement of dissident artists and intellectuals in Havana, make a daring appearance to rap about the government’s repression of the group. In November security agents dressed as health-care workers arrested 15 of its members, who were on a hunger strike to protest against the arrest of a rapper accused of disrespecting authority. The video shows clips of demonstrations by supporters of the movement. It has been watched nearly 2m times on YouTube, mostly outside Cuba. On the island, where access to the internet is expensive, people are sharing it on USB sticks.

The regime is rattled. Two days after the song’s release, Cuban state television interrupted normal prime-time programming to encourage citizens to clap and sing the national anthem, “La Bayamesa”, which proclaims that “to die for one’s country is to live”. State newspapers and websites published long articles claiming that anti-Cuban mafias in Miami were manipulating the musicians. “Patria y Vida” is musical propaganda that can never replace the revolutionary slogan, declared Abel Prieto Jiménez, president of Casa de las Américas, a cultural institution. The spirit of Patria o Muerte led to the development of Soberana 02, a Cuban covid-19 vaccine that is expected to enter phase-three trials in March, said Eduardo Martínez, president of BioCubaFarma, the jab’s inventor. Perhaps the tagline Patria y Vida seemed too obvious for a vaccine.

In this life-and-death struggle, death still has the upper hand. A member of the San Isidro movement painted Patria y Vida on his house in Havana. On February 22nd a pro-government mob covered the graffito with officially approved slogans in electric blue. Although the government recently expanded the number of trades open to self-employed entrepreneurs, art, music and intellectual rumination are still subject to strict state control. The domino-players are becoming more animated, but the game remains frozen. ■","['cubas', 'rattles', 'miami', 'patria', 'y', 'state', 'music', 'president', 'zona', 'movement', 'havana', 'regime', 'vida', 'reggaeton', 'rebellion', 'video']",2021-02-27 00:00:00
162,['The Economist'],"“W E ARE LIVING a stellar moment,” declared Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, this month, a little over two years after he took office. It is hard to find evidence of that. Even by the standards of a covid-ravaged world, the country is doing poorly. Mexico has the fourth-highest number of excess deaths as a share of population since the pandemic’s onset. Its economy was in recession before the pandemic arrived (see chart). The poverty rate probably rose more than in Latin America’s other big economies. Almost half of Mexico’s 126m people could not afford to eat properly at the end of 2020, according to official figures. Whereas murder rates have dropped sharply in some violent Latin American countries during the pandemic, in Mexico the decline has been tiny.

Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.

If the moment is not stellar, most ordinary Mexicans trust Mr López Obrador, often simply called AMLO , soon to make it so. According to a recent poll, his approval rating is 62%. Another survey found that nearly 40% of Mexicans plan to vote for his party, Morena, in legislative and regional elections due in June. The two most popular opposition parties have a quarter of that level of support each (and a third of voters are undecided). AMLO ’s popularity is evident in places like Ecatepec, a municipality near Mexico City that is as poor, violent and covid-blighted as anywhere. Some neighbourhoods lack water; walls are plastered with posters for missing people and help applying for visas to the United States. “We have not yet seen results” from AMLO , admits Efrain Salguero, a local driver. “I think we should give him more time.”

Mr Salguero is among the millions of Mexicans who still have high hopes for AMLO ’s “fourth transformation”, which is to make the country work better by ending corruption and rampant crime and distributing gains from economic growth more fairly. He envisions it as the successor to the war of independence of 1810-21, the war for liberal reform of 1858-61 and the revolution of 1910-17. But in two years of transformation AMLO has changed Mexico much less than did these momentous events, and mostly for the worse.

In practice, the fourth transformation seems to have three main elements: the undoing of recent reforms; new initiatives that fail to solve the problems they purport to; and concentration of power in the president’s hands.

Reforms enacted by AMLO ’s “neoliberal” predecessors, however sensible, were quick to go. Early in 2019 he scrapped an education reform introduced by Enrique Peña Nieto, his immediate predecessor, that linked teachers’ pay and promotions to the performance of their pupils. AMLO abolished Prospera, a much lauded conditional cash-transfer programme for the poor. Handouts, for example to farmers, are now presented as presidential gifts.

AMLO tried to reverse the opening of energy markets, once dominated by state monopolies, to private and foreign enterprises. Mexico’s Congress is debating a bill under which electricity generated by state-owned CFE would get priority access to the grid, in preference to cheaper alternatives. This would not only raise prices for consumers but could breach the US -Mexico-Canada Agreement ( USMCA ), North America’s free-trade pact. It would put at risk some 150 renewable-energy projects that are expected to bring more than $40bn-worth of investment, and make it impossible for Mexico to reach its commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. AMLO cancelled the construction of a $13bn airport for Mexico City that was already half-built. These policies have undermined the confidence of investors.

If all this were a prelude to enacting bold ideas for improving Mexicans’ well-being, the cost might be tolerable. But AMLO ’s solutions are bullets discharged from an antique gun that is badly aimed and packed with too little fiscal firepower. His dedication to fiscal discipline, laudable in a populist of the left, became counterproductive in the pandemic. In a bizarre role reversal, the IMF is urging Mexico to spend much more than the 0.7% of GDP it has done to fight the pandemic’s economic effects. Brazil, by contrast, has spent 8% of GDP , and Argentina 3.8%. AMLO resists because he fears that Mexico could become beholden to foreign creditors as it did during a financial crisis in 1982.

His tightfistedness, some economists fear, will lead to “scarring”—a permanent drop in output caused by a loss of jobs and businesses during the pandemic. Bound by fiscal constraints, the patron of the poor has done little to protect them. He has shuffled money around, slashing spending on the government apparatus and boosting it on pet social programmes. He has doubled old-age pensions and aims to pay 2.3m young adults to study or take up apprenticeships. Overall, though, social spending has risen little. Social programmes are being “done on the cheap”, says Javier Tello, a television commentator. A sharp rise in the minimum wage has helped some workers with formal jobs. Businesses pay for that.

Where AMLO has splashed out is on old-economy projects that will deliver little return. He has poured money into Pemex, the world’s most indebted oil company, and plans to spend $8bn to build the Dos Bocas refinery in his home state of Tabasco. Airlines think the mountainous terrain around the military airport that is to become the alternative civilian hub for Mexico City will restrict flights.

The fourth transformation has not lessened the greatest dangers to Mexicans’ safety, one new and one old. The government’s handling of the pandemic has been disastrous. Its miserly social spending has contributed to a widespread feeling that unsafe work is the only alternative to going hungry. AMLO has been spotted just once wearing a face mask (most Mexicans do wear one). Mexico tests few people for covid-19 by international standards. Hospitals are full and oxygen tanks are in short supply. Vaccination got off to a very slow start. People who hoped that AMLO would show a greater sense of urgency after he contracted covid-19 were disappointed. On February 8th he reappeared after a two-week convalescence. He caught the bug, he said, because like many Mexicans he cannot stop working.

The voters who gave AMLO his landslide election win in 2018 wanted, perhaps more than anything else, a big reduction in the country’s high number of murders. They are still waiting. AMLO proclaimed last year’s 0.4% dip a “significant success”, but it comes after a rise the year before. Murders of women, which led to mass protests last year, stayed at record levels in 2020.

AMLO rejected previous governments’ tactic of killing or capturing crime kingpins, because this led to a splintering of gangs and thus to more violence. But his signature policies for combating crime have not so far worked. His notion that reducing poverty will ultimately lower crime “might stop a three-year-old becoming El Chapo”, a notorious drug lord, says Mr Tello. “But it doesn’t have an answer for the current El Chapos.” Formerly suspicious of the armed forces, AMLO issued a decree giving them primary responsibility for fighting crime. A new 100,000-strong National Guard is composed mainly of soldiers rather than people trained in policing.

AMLO has fought the gentler crime of corruption by setting an example of probity and imposing stiffer penalties on bribe-taking bureaucrats. He has done less to strengthen institutions that will carry the battle forward. The national anti-corruption prosecutor is overwhelmed with cases. A proposal by anti-graft prosecutors for constitutional guarantees of their autonomy and a minimum budget “has not found traction with López Obrador’s congressional majority”, according to a recent report by WOLA , a think-tank in Washington. An autonomous government agency estimates that the number of acts of corruption rose by 19% between 2017 and 2019. The vast majority of government contracts are not open to tender.

Ordinary Mexicans have overlooked AMLO ’s failures because he has a bond with them that most presidents lacked. “He is from the people, for the people and with the people,” says Daniel Sibaja, a Morena official in Ecatepec. His popularity flows from who he is rather than what he does. Power thus flows to him.

AMLO sets the national agenda in daily morning press conferences that can last three hours. He has cut the budgets and dismissed the bosses of autonomous institutions such as Coneval, which measures poverty. Last month he proposed to abolish several autonomous agencies, including the antitrust body and freedom-of-information institute. He rails against critical media and ratings agencies.","['better', 'peoples', 'little', 'crime', 's', 'transformer', 'president', 'lives', 'amlo', 'mexicos', 'spending', 'pandemic', 'mexicans', 'mexico', 'transformation', 'social']",2021-02-20 00:00:00
163,['The Economist'],"A BAN ON SINGLE-USE plastics sounded like a good idea. But it has ended up enraging many women in Mexico’s capital, a city of 9.2m. Last week they discovered that they could no longer buy tampons with plastic applicators.

Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.

Mexico City’s government, which is led by a woman, Claudia Sheinbaum, has been implementing the law since the start of 2021. Its aim is to reduce the city’s solid waste, thought to be second only to the amount produced by the New York metropolitan area, measured by weight. Plastic bags, cups and straws have already been banned. It took until now for tampons with plastic applicators, the only kind that were easily available, to run out of stock in most shops.

Regina Soltero, a 23-year-old doctor who works 24-hour shifts treating covid-19 patients in a public hospital, says she depends on them. “They are comfortable and less likely to leak on my white uniform,” she says. Marina Robles, the city’s environment minister, added to women’s anger by declaring that tampons are not essential items. They are used mainly by prosperous women. Women should instead try reusable menstrual cups, which are made of rubber, said a city legislator.

Most Mexican women use pads, which are cheaper. Some young women think tampons cause them to lose their virginity, says Sandra Peniche, a doctor who runs a sexual-health organisation in Mérida in Mexico’s south-east. Others simply don’t know much about them. Dr Peniche has seen women who have worn a tampon for three days or had sex without removing it.

The ban is unlikely to help the environment much. Pads, which many women will now have to use—“I hate them,” says Dr Soltero—are at least as polluting. The ban will probably be quickly circumvented. Tampons are on sale in towns just outside the city. Pharmacies inside it are reportedly selling them under the counter. As Sergio Sarmiento, a journalist, pointed out, the ban doesn’t affect condoms, some of which are made of polyurethane, “despite them being plastic and used only once (I hope)”.

Dr Peniche reckons the tampon ban is yet another example of women’s needs being ignored—or worse. Last year, when thousands took to the streets to protest against a rise in murders of women, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, an ally of Ms Sheinbaum, called them conservative opponents in disguise.","['unintended', 'plastics', 'peniche', 'took', 'tampon', 'citys', 'tampons', 'city', 'tempest', 'plastic', 'used', 'ban', 'womens', 'women', 'mexico', 'consequence']",2021-02-20 00:00:00
164,['The Economist'],"He was right to try to open Argentina’s economy, but wrong to let cronyism thrive

I N BUENOS AIRES in 1997 Carlos Menem hosted a regional “Davos” of international business types. With a dull evening reception under way, Argentina’s president swept in, cheeks shining and eyes flashing, dispensing bear hugs, starlets in tow. Your columnist felt a jolt of political electricity course through the assembled suits. So discredited was Mr Menem by the time he died, aged 90, on February 14th that it is hard to remember that he was once acclaimed as a Latin American economic visionary.

Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.

On taking office in 1989 amid hyperinflation, he swiftly grasped that Argentines wanted price stability and economic order above all else. He tore up the populist programme on which he had been elected and the statist economic doctrines of his Peronist movement, and implemented what he called “major surgery without anaesthetic”. Domingo Cavallo, his economy minister, imposed “convertibility”, a law under which the peso was fixed at par to the dollar and the supply of pesos was restricted to the Central Bank’s hard-currency reserves. Having persuaded Congress to grant him sweeping powers, Mr Menem slashed import tariffs, subsidies and curbs on foreign investment, and privatised hundreds of state enterprises, from the railways to the oil company.

At first it worked. Inflation dissipated, foreign capital poured in and the economy roared. Mr Menem basked in popularity. Having changed the constitution to allow re-election, he easily won a second term in 1995. But unemployment rose, too. Under convertibility, Mr Menem had forsworn both monetary and exchange-rate freedom. When foreign capital poured out of emerging markets, Argentina suffered a slump culminating in financial collapse in 2001-02. In what until the 1970s had been a middle-class society, the poverty rate soared to 56% and unemployment to 21%. Mr Menem handed health care and education to provincial governments without giving them more resources. Argentina acquired Latin American social inequalities.

Not all of this was Mr Menem’s fault, but much was. His lasting legacy was a record so notorious as to shut off rational discussion about economic policy in Latin America for a generation. He and his Argentina were indelibly branded as “neoliberal” slaves to the “Washington consensus”. By extension, liberalism and a capitalist economy were damned.

This charge sheet was based on a blurring of political identity. Peronism is an alliance between trade unions and the caudillos of the backward north, men such as Mr Menem, who was governor of the province of La Rioja. His keystone, convertibility, divided economic liberals: some thought it necessary in a country with a hyperinflationary past; others saw it as a conservative policy, akin to the gold standard. It certainly violated a tenet of the Washington consensus, which called for a competitive exchange rate to stimulate exports. Convertibility’s fixed peso quickly became overvalued, so the trade opening killed some potentially viable manufacturing firms.

Mr Menem himself undermined convertibility by piling up foreign debt to spend on political clientelism in a quest for an unconstitutional third term. He should instead have helped the unemployed with retraining and public works. In many cases his privatisations created monopolies, or rewarded cronies. He abolished some economic privileges only to create others. These mistakes did much to discredit privatisation, deregulation and economic openness. Their subsequent lack is one reason Latin America has scarcely grown economically for the past seven years. The boldness of his reforms would be welcome in, for example, today’s Brazil.

Forgotten is the mess that Argentina’s statist, protectionist economy was in when Mr Menem took over. In ministries, broken typewriters (yes), toilets and lifts languished unrepaired; state-owned companies lost 6% of GDP per year; only half the locomotives of the state railways worked; businesses employed staff whose sole job was to hold a telephone handset for hours to get a line.

Mr Menem was a democrat—he was briefly jailed by a dictatorship in 1976. But he was an illiberal one. He packed the Supreme Court and the audit tribunal. In his inner circle influence-trafficking, corruption and links to organised crime flourished. During his presidency, politics merged with la farándula (the more vulgar end of show business). When the economy dived, the glitter became a mockery. This was Mr Menem’s failure, not liberalism’s.","['tarnished', 'caudillo', 'convertibility', 'political', 'menem', 'carlos', 'bello', 'mr', 'economic', 'latin', 'conservative', 'argentina', 'liberalism', 'economy', 'argentinas', 'foreign']",2021-02-17 00:00:00
165,['The Economist'],"F OR A DECADE Rafael Correa, a leftist populist, ruled Ecuador as an autocrat. Enjoying an oil boom, he doubled the size of the state, built roads and hospitals, curbed the media, harassed opponents and presided over corruption. As money got tight, he lined up a proxy: Lenín Moreno, his former vice-president, narrowly won a presidential election in 2017 against Guillermo Lasso, a conservative banker. But then Mr Correa’s plan unravelled.

Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.

Faced with an oil bust, Mr Moreno broke with his predecessor in both economics and politics. Since Ecuador adopted the dollar in 2000, it cannot devalue when exports fall. Instead of saving part of the oil windfall Mr Correa had piled up debt. Mr Moreno had little choice but to adopt austerity. An ill-managed attempt to withdraw fuel subsidies prompted widespread protests in October 2019 and, with the pandemic, left his government deeply unpopular.

That has offered Mr Correa, who is in Belgium, another chance for a comeback. Sentenced in absentia to eight years in jail for corruption, he picked a new proxy for the presidential election on February 7th. Andrés Arauz, a loyal former minister but dull campaigner, promises to convoke a constituent assembly with the seeming purpose of taking control of the judiciary, overturning Mr Correa’s sentence and allowing him in effect to run the country.

Whether Mr Correa’s gambit works turns in part on whom Mr Arauz, who won 33% of the vote, faces in a run-off on April 11th. For 60 hours after the polls closed it looked as if that would be Yaku Pérez of Pachakutik, an indigenous party. After a review of votes that had been set aside because of administrative errors by polling officials—many in Guayaquil, the main port—Mr Lasso squeezed ahead with 19.7% to Mr Pérez’s 19.6%.

On his Twitter account Mr Correa had been rooting for a fight with Mr Lasso once again. This would be a straightforward left-right contest, and two-thirds of voters backed candidates to the left of centre. Mr Lasso is tarred not just by being “the banker candidate”, as Mr Arauz calls him, but also by his support for Mr Moreno’s government. In much of Latin America today, disdain for incumbents trumps all else.

However, Mr Correa’s appeal is waning. Mr Arauz’s share of the vote was seven points lower than Mr Moreno’s in the first round in 2017. As Mr Lasso put it, two-thirds “have voted no to the totalitarian and populist model that is trying to return”. Mr Pérez, who claimed fraud, had a better chance of harvesting anti-correismo. He grew up in a house without running water. He studied law, became an environmental activist and changed his first name from Carlos to Yaku, meaning “water” in the Quechuan languages of the Andes. He abhors Mr Correa, whose government detained him five times for opposing mining projects. Campaigning partly on a bicycle, he has a reputation for honesty. Whereas Mr Correa is an ally of the dictators in Venezuela and Cuba, Mr Pérez is not. His political affinities look more green than red. Will he now endorse Mr Lasso?

The next president faces some unforgiving realities. Hit hard by the pandemic and its recession, Ecuador’s economy is recovering only slowly after contracting by 9% last year. A $6.5bn loan from the IMF , of which $4bn has already been disbursed, requires the government to cut the fiscal deficit from 7.8% of GDP last year to 2.8% this year. That will be less hard than it looks: tax revenues are recovering and Mr Moreno’s debt renegotiation saved 1.5% of GDP in interest that would have fallen due this year. Even so, the new government will have to cut spending or raise taxes—and probably both—fairly soon.

Mr Arauz promises a $1bn giveaway to families in his first week. He wants to pay for this by using the Central Bank’s reserves. Since their function in a dollarised economy is to back bank deposits, that risks a bank run. Mr Lasso opposes raising VAT , but otherwise supports the IMF programme and fiscal restraint.

The next government will not have a majority in the parliament. Mr Correa’s allies will form the largest bloc and his sister Pierina may be the legislature’s speaker. Ecuador’s drama is that the dollar has given it stability, but can bring rapid growth only if governments undertake sweeping reforms. When president, Mr Correa squandered an oil-fuelled opportunity to do that. History suggests that with less money, populists become more authoritarian. To prevent that, anti-correismo will need to overcome anti-bankerism.","['election', 'ecuadors', 'heir', 'cyclist', 'oil', 'morenos', 'correa', 'bello', 'correas', 'mr', 'highstakes', 'yaku', 'banker', 'arauz', 'moreno', 'lasso', 'pérez']",2021-02-13 00:00:00

He was less than 30 years old.

Activism has long been a dangerous vocation in Colombia. From the 1980s to the early 2000s right-wing paramilitary groups murdered trade unionists, Communists and peasant leaders. The FARC , a guerrilla group that demobilised after a peace deal with the government in 2016, kidnapped farmers who opposed them.

Peace, it was thought, would bring safety for social leaders, as Colombians call activists. In fact, it has brought more peril. At least 400 rights-defenders have been killed since 2016, according to the UN ’s human-rights commissioner. Colombia’s ombudsman has documented 710 such murders during the same period. Last month 19 activists were killed or went missing, according to Indepaz, a think-tank.

One reason may be that peace has encouraged more activists to make more demands, says Juan Carlos Garzón of the Ideas for Peace Foundation, a think-tank. They campaign for causes that were overshadowed by war, such as the rights of indigenous and Afro-Colombian people, land reform, protecting the environment and corruption-free government.

A more obvious reason is the rise of armed groups that are fighting for control of territories vacated by the FARC . These include the ELN and the EPL guerrilla outfits and gangs composed of FARC and paramilitary fighters who refused to disarm. In Nariño, in south-western Colombia, drug-trafficking groups attack advocates of a government programme that encourages farmers to switch from growing coca, used to make cocaine, to legal crops like cacao.

Most activists slain in Cauca were indigenous or Afro-Colombian leaders trying to expel armed groups from territories reserved for them. In Norte de Santander, in the north-east, the ELN and the EPL are at war with each other and with local worthies, such as football coaches, whom they suspect of supporting their foes.

The state remains absent from large swathes of Colombia’s territory. The government sends soldiers to kill drug-traffickers and other troublemakers. But it has not set up institutions needed to enforce the law consistently. Without order, it is left to protect social leaders one by one.

Iván Duque, Colombia’s conservative president, has made an effort. In 2018 he created the “timely action plan” to come up with policies to protect social leaders. The government holds meetings to discuss alerts issued by the ombudsman about specific risks to social leaders. A “national protection unit” has given hundreds of leaders cell phones, bulletproof vests and even bodyguards and armoured vehicles.

These are half-measures. When the ombudsman identifies threats, officials rarely propose action to head them off, says a person who attended their meetings. The interior ministry, which has no enforcement powers, is in charge of the timely action plan. Other agencies, such as the defence ministry, are supposed to protect social leaders. But they do not co-ordinate with each other outside Bogotá, says Mr Garzón.

Another problem is mistrust. Activists are cynical about a government that is largely absent from their regions. Left-wing parties have used the murders as a cudgel against Mr Duque’s government. Some of his allies dismiss their outrage as an expression of castrochavismo—socialist ideas from Cuba and Venezuela. Activists sometimes refuse to meet officials to discuss how to protect them.

On February 10th Human Rights Watch, a global pressure group, urged the government to establish police forces and law courts in regions where social leaders are being slaughtered. Mr Duque, whose term ends in 2022, is running out of time to do that. Meanwhile, tragedies like the murder of Mr Güetio will keep occurring.■","['anarchy', 'activists', 'protect', 'leaders', 'amid', 'groups', 'ombudsman', 'colombias', 'indigenous', 'mr', 'peace', 'murdered', 'rights', 'social']",2021-02-13 00:00:00
167,['The Economist'],"“W HAT IS IMPORTANT is seldom urgent,” declared Dwight Eisenhower. “And what is urgent is seldom important.” Eisenhower did not have to lead America through covid-19. The urgency and importance of the task over the past year have banished pretty much everything else from most leaders' minds. But now that the vaccine is kicking in, Britain’s government is once again beginning to think about the things that will matter later. Next week, along with a budget designed to deal with the fiscal strains on the country, it is expected to publish a “plan for growth” to boost productivity, with innovation at its centre.

Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.

The government is right to try to pull the innovation lever. The world may be on the threshold of a technological boom with life sciences, at which Britain excels, at its heart. Innovation is crucial to productivity, and on this front Britain’s performance has lagged behind its competitors’ in recent years. Its low spending on R & D —less than three-quarters of the OECD average, as a share of GDP —argues for a boost.

Those who remember the 1970s may regard this as a dangerous road to take. Promoting innovation can quickly turn into an exercise in picking winners—or, as is more often the case, losers. The government’s $500m purchase last year of a stake in OneWeb, a bankrupt satellite firm, suggests that it has forgotten the humiliating lessons of that dismal decade. A second danger is that policy agendas get mixed up. The government has promised to “level up” poorer areas of the country, so deprived towns are lobbying for more money for their universities. But trying to boost innovation by sending money to weak institutions is likely to lead to average universities producing unremarkable ideas. Britain’s research-funding system is ruthlessly elitist. It should stay that way.

The government’s first move in boosting innovation was the announcement on February 19th of a plan for an Advanced Research and Invention Agency ( ARIA ), which is modelled on America’s Advanced Research Projects Agency. That is a promising start. ARIA ’s purpose is to fund high-risk, high-reward research, probably by directly funding exceptional scientists. But money is not all that matters. The successful translation of life-science research into treatments during the pandemic (see article) suggests some inexpensive measures that can also make a difference. One is to speed up governmental processes. The rapidity with which Britain’s medical regulator moved during the pandemic is one reason the vaccine roll-out is racing through the population and drugs identified in Britain are saving lives around the world. Urgency is not unique to pandemics. Getting things done quickly can make an investment worthwhile and determine where an entrepreneur chooses as a base. Another useful measure that the government should use is its unique ability to overcome barriers. At the beginning of the pandemic covid-19 researchers were, for instance, unable to gain access to different strands of health-service data. The government eased restrictions on existing data and allowed researchers to ask people who had tested positive for covid-19 to join trials. Both were crucial to the effort. A last principle is the value of connections between the government and the private sector. Kate Bingham, a venture capitalist who led the vaccine-procurement effort, understood how to deal with drug companies. Many of the civil servants working with her had commercial experience. The government’s closeness to business during the pandemic has been criticised, and perhaps some wasteful contracts were awarded to cronies. But without it, the vaccine effort would not have succeeded.

Innovation took human beings from caves to computers. It is elusive stuff. Good education, a welcoming immigration regime and a friendly business environment will do most to tend it. But a few sensible principles can help keep the flame burning. ■

168,['The Economist'],"I N “L’ENFER” , a recent novel by the French philosopher Gaspard Koenig, a university professor dies only to discover that hell is an eternity spent traipsing around airport duty-free shops. Others seem to enjoy the experience rather more. Travel retail has grown into a mastodon, with annual sales of $86bn before the pandemic hit. It is busy adapting by expanding beyond the airport terminal, notably in China (see article). As it does, its tax privileges are becoming ever more indefensible.

Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.

The premise underpinning duty-free is that the mere act of crossing an international border should exempt travellers from some taxes that non-travellers are subject to. This was a questionable wheeze even when European airports lobbied for it in the 1950s. Now it is untenable. Modern tax codes typically seek to dampen inequality, but duty-free shopping hands most benefits to the well-heeled who frequently travel abroad. Taxes could usefully nudge people to be greener. Duty rebates overwhelmingly fall into the pockets of people who fly and pollute. One goal of excise tariffs is to curb the harmful use of tobacco and alcohol, but airport shopping is explicitly designed to circumvent them. As duty-free shopping has ballooned, what was once a wrinkle has swelled into a tax-avoidance scheme for jet-setters.

Duty-free’s boosters argue that the income from shops is essential to sustain airports, which might otherwise need more taxpayer funding. Retail income, not all of which is exempt of duties, is indeed their biggest source of cash after fees paid by airlines. The figure is inflated by the astronomical rents that airports can charge retailers, skimming off up to 40% of their sales. But it is a textbook case of allowing an exorbitant privilege to generate unjustified profits which are then shared around opaquely. If airports need state help, especially after the pandemic, it should be paid transparently, not through tax dodges that distort economic incentives.","['dutyfree', 'travel', 'retail', 'airports', 'airport', 'sales', 'end', 'shoppingindustrial', 'complex', 'shopping', 'shops', 'tax', 'taxes']",2021-02-27 00:00:00

Politics costs money everywhere, but the link between cash and power is especially corrosive in Nigeria and across much of Africa. In rich democracies parties choose candidates and subsidise their campaigns. In many African ones aspiring politicians pay vast sums to run on a party ticket and then shell out even more to cover their own costs. They give voters handouts, which serve both as bribes and as hints of future generosity. Once in office, they keep spending: on constituents’ school fees, medical bills, funeral costs and construction projects (see article). Individual politicians, in effect, act as mini welfare states. Some 40% of ambulances in Uganda are owned by MP s. Their spending often dwarfs their official salaries.

This is bad for Africa. When a life in politics costs so much, the impecunious and honest will be excluded. Many MP s will either be rich to begin with, or feel the need to abuse power to recoup their expenses, or both. Even if they are not corrupt, MP s are a poor substitute for a genuine welfare state. Their largesse may go to those who ask loudest, or to a favoured ethnic group.

So long as states are weak, it makes sense for voters to ask their MP s for handouts, rather than for better laws or help to navigate the bureaucracy. It is also rational for MP s to neglect legislative work in favour of gifts and pork, if this is what voters say they want. But as Africa develops, this should change. As voters grow richer, they will be harder to buy. As governments grow more effective, MP s will have fewer gaps to fill. Alas, these shifts could take decades.

Africans need something better, sooner. Outsiders often suggest tougher campaign-finance laws, but these seldom work. They are often ignored. And laws copied from the West tend to miss the point, by regulating spending by parties before elections, rather than by sitting MP s.

Better would be to take a different approach. One aim would be to strengthen institutions that expose and punish corruption. Last year Malawians booted out the graft-ridden regime of Peter Mutharika thanks, in large part, to independent judges. Politicians who see graft punished are more likely to stay clean.

Another aim would be to encourage parties to run on policies, rather than ethnicity or patronage. African NGO s, trade unions and business groups should nudge them in this direction—or help set up alternatives. New parties, such as Bobi Wine’s National Unity Platform in Uganda, are gaining popularity partly because they oppose the old rot. Philanthropists could give them money—and ask nothing in return.

The essential thing is to curb MP s’ informal role as sources of welfare. The long-term fix would be to make local governments work properly. A stopgap is to improve Constituency Development Funds. These are pots of public money to be spent largely at the discretion of MP s. More than a dozen African countries have them. They are not as grubby as they sound. Research from Kenya finds that voters judge MP s on how they use these funds, so they offer some accountability. With greater transparency, they would offer more.

Africa has grown more democratic in the past 30 years. Multi-party elections are common, albeit often flawed. Opposition parties are gaining ground. Most leaders leave office peacefully, rather than in coups. Politics is becoming more competitive. The next step is to make it less costly. ■","['voters', 'politics', 's', 'money', 'work', 'office', 'men', 'african', 'welfare', 'mp', 'spending', 'costs', 'parties', 'politicians', 'costly', 'big']",2021-02-27 00:00:00

The gale of creative destruction used to blow hard in Silicon Valley. The list of firms toppled from dominance runs from Fairchild Semiconductor to Hewlett-Packard. Yet recently the giants have clung on: Apple and Microsoft are over 40 years old and Alphabet and Amazon over 20; even Facebook is 17 this month. What happened? Network and scale effects mean that size begets size, while data can act as a barrier to entry. Search, social media, advertising, e-commerce, streaming, ride-hailing, delivery and payments all exhibit these alchemical properties to some degree. Having achieved supremacy in their chosen area, many tech firms, especially the big ones, have shown little appetite to compete directly with each other in the past decade. The three most common searches on Microsoft Bing are Facebook, YouTube and Google. Does anyone remember Amazon’s Fire Phone?

At first glance nothing has changed. Tech firms enjoyed a lucrative 2020 and investors are betting more is to come. The $7.6trn market value of America’s five giants implies their sales will double in the next decade. Yet if you look more closely, a shift is under way. The incumbents are not getting smaller—their weighted-average market share is stable, at about 35% across each of 11 American tech subsectors. But the share of second and third firms has risen from 18% to 26% since 2015. This reflects two deeper trends.

First, big tech firms are diversifying as their core products mature, new technological opportunities emerge and regulatory threats mount in America, Europe and China. The firms have talked about this for years, but now it is happening. The share of the five American giants’ revenues that overlaps with the others has risen from 22% to 38% since 2015. Microsoft and Alphabet are taking on Amazon in the cloud. Amazon is, in turn, the rising force in digital advertising.

The second trend, accounting for a third of the shift in market share, is that outsiders have momentum. From the ranks of the corporate establishment, Disney, aged 98, has acquired 116m new streaming customers in 18 months, while Walmart, aged 58, booked $38bn in online sales last year. Independent tech firms such as Shopify in e-commerce and PayPal have broken through thanks to the digital surge caused by the pandemic, and are generating enough profits to be self-sustaining.

You might think that this competition is just a blip, but it has a precedent in Asia, where customers have leapfrogged ahead and the boundaries between products have blurred, leading to market-share shifts, lower margins and innovation. China has Alibaba and Tencent and five other contenders worth $100bn or more. India has Jio and South-East Asia has Grab, Gojek and Sea. All these firms think in terms of subscribers who could be persuaded to buy a fluid range of services, rather than of protecting a static monopoly at all costs. They seek expansion through diversification, even if that means bumping up against rivals.

One danger is that this oligopolistic rivalry is a Potemkin contest. It has not yet disrupted the Apple-Alphabet duopoly over phone-operating systems or app stores. Although advertisers have more choice, between, say, Amazon and Facebook, those being advertised to still have no real alternative to the products of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss. And there are too many cosy links between firms. Alphabet pays Apple up to $12bn a year to make Google the iPhone’s default search engine. Alibaba and Tencent own stakes in some of China’s new entrants.

This is where resurgent antitrust enforcers can make a difference. Those Google payments are now subject to a Department of Justice lawsuit, while Apple and Google face complaints over their app stores. Europe is planning rules to get different firms’ products to work together and help users move their data around. China has a new list of “the nine do nots” for e-commerce firms, including not shutting out new contenders.

It helps that ambition is plentiful. In attracting business to its cloud platform, Alphabet is losing $6bn a year—more than Amazon has lost in its lifetime. Disney plans to have 325m subscribers by 2024. PayPal intends to have 750m users of its financial super-app by 2025. Walmart has just bought an advertising firm. Facebook is entering e-commerce. Microsoft has considered buying two social-media firms, TikTok and Pinterest. Huawei in China is busy creating an alternative to the i OS -Android operating-system duopoly.

Oligopolistic competition could benefit consumers in several ways. It could boost choice as more firms compete to offer an expanding range of services: 11 American firms have over 100m digital subscribers. It could raise standards as platforms differentiate themselves by trust. That is why Apple will soon ask iPhone users if they want to opt out of Facebook’s data-tracking, upending the advertising market (see article). And it could spur innovation as firms search for new tools, such as virtual reality, to control access to the customer.

Back in 2000 few predicted that tech was destined for monopoly, then it became accepted wisdom. Today no one knows if the emerging pattern of oligopolistic rivalry will last or benefit consumers. But the conditions are more promising than they have been for years. Regulators are trying to prise open closed markets, a financial boom means that capital is abundant and a global surge in online activity has boosted demand. A more contested digital economy would be consequential—for markets, consumers and businesses alike. It is looking more likely. ■","['tech', 'competition', 'digital', 'products', 'firms', 'microsoft', 'game', 'changing', 'facebook', 'rules', 'amazon', 'apple', 'share', 'users']",2021-02-27 00:00:00
