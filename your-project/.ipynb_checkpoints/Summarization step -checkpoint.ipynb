      "the country is the only in europe to avoid some kind of lockdownlondon  swedens novel approach to tackling the coronavirus pandemic has drawn both praise and fierce criticism not just inside the scandinavian country but across the western world the country has so far resisted going into lockdown unlike the rest of europe even during the peak of its second wave over christmasin doing so sweden has become a lightning rod for those in favor and against stricter social distancing measures for some its significantly higher covid death rate compared to its neighbors is proof that lockdowns are essential to combat the spread while for others the comparative openness of swedish society proves that a balanced approach to the pandemic is possiblenow a year into the pandemic and with a vaccine rollout likely in the near future their strategy continues to attract international attention abc news looked at the pitfalls and merits of their approach in may last year and a year later the evidence shows that now as much as ever their unique approach offers invaluable lessons to the international community for living in the long term with covidthe softtouch approachdenmark norway and finland with a combined population of around  million have recorded  deaths attributed to coronavirus as of thursday  per million all three enforced lockdowns early on in the pandemic sweden by contrast has registered  deaths and possesses a population  million meaning it has a far higher death rate than its immediate neighbors  per million according to johns hopkins university datafor critics of the light touch approach such as stefan hanson a swedish infectious diseases expert such a high death rate is evidence of the failure of an overall strategythe basic problem is there are no clear plans he told abc news from the start there never as have been normally when you run a public health project you have some aims and strategies you have some goals and you follow up you have a monitoring system to see how things are going but in the case of sweden there has been nothing like thatits all about having a low transmission and sweden hasnt put that forward as a very important thing he added in april  hanson was cosignatory to a letter from several top swedish scientists criticizing the approach to the pandemic which they said would cause many unnecessary deathsyet even throughout europes second wave which saw stockholms intensive care units almost run out of beds over the christmas period the country has resisted the temptation to lock down being the only country in europe to do so december saw a very rare intervention from king carl xvi gustaf who said the country had failed in its approach the strategy pioneered by anders tegnell swedens state epidemiologist has been heavily criticized not just at home but abroad as well false optimism that the capital stockholm would reach herd immunity by fall has compounded that criticismherd immunity occurs when there are enough people who have either been vaccinated or exposed to the virus that it can no longer spread in the population critics say that doing so by exposure to the virus creates unnecessary riskyet as with so much of the data relating to covid proponents of the policy say that reading the data is a matter of perspectivesweden may be faring comparably better in terms of excess deaths  those greater than the usual number of deaths expected in a certain time period experts say excess deaths can indicate whether policies intended to combat the pandemic have unintended consequences such as delaying treatment for other ailments and is an important measure of the overall efficacy of policywhile still performing worse than other nordic countries on data from eurostat the official european union statistics agency and the university of oxford shows that sweden recorded  excess deaths last year compared to the years  according to the independent health news site dagens medicinthat means that the country had the rd lowest annual excess deaths out of  european countries  lower than the uk  france  and spain  sweden also has a lower number of coronavirus deaths per million than those countries all of which have gone under strict lockdowns during the pandemic pointing to the recent excess mortality studies nils karlson an economist and political scientist who jointly wrote an oped last year in foreign affairs entitled swedens coronavirus strategy will soon be the worlds is more optimisticthere was some recent figures showing that if you count excess mortality sweden is one of the best countries in europe he told abc news and one of the reason is of course that we didnt get the flu just the ordinary flu because we wash our hands we have social distancing we didnt have as many car accidents you know all kinds of other stuff that that affects us didnt happen this yearthe resistance to lockdown he said is based on the idea that they are unsustainable he said and swedens strategy takes into account not just economic factors but all aspects of public life while acknowledges the covid death toll was too high he said you have to keep society open not only for economic reasons but also for critical public functions to to function like hospitals schools and so on schools are still open for younger kids otherwise its remote learning but i think it has worked fairly wellthe care home crisisone area where there has been consensus however is the crisis in the swedish old age care sector where the crisis has taken a terrible tollcare home residents have made up around half of the countrys total death toll with a further quarter of the deaths being seen amongst over s who receive care at homethe big thing was that the whole pandemic we know that old people like in old age care were the people who were really the people who were mostly going to die and the people who mostly went to hospitals ingmar skoog a swedish psychiatrist who specializes in studying old age told abc news despite that they didnt take in any expert in old agethe swedish government introduced more protective equipment and testing as did other countries and restricted care home visitsa governmentappointed commission concluded in december that high rates of infection in the general population as well as a fragmented administration which made it difficult to produce consistent policy contributed to the crisiswe have found that elderly care was unprepared and illequipped when the pandemic struck and that this was founded in structural shortcomings that were known long before the outbreak of the virus the report saidwhile it is obvious that higher rates of infection make it more likely for the virus to sweep through old age care homes skoog said part of the problem has been a fundamental misunderstanding of the sheer number of persontoperson contacts those in care go through every single daythey meet a lot of people very intimately because they get help with the clothing maybe food dressing hygiene going to the toilet and so on according to skoog and people are very very close and that means that they meet a lot of younger people i think one of the first things that really should have been done was to talk with experts in the field and say what should we dobut deaths at nursing facilities even plagued countries that implemented lockdowns and took measures to protect nursing home residentsa report from the european center for disease control in november found that long term care residents made up  of the total coronavirus deaths in france and  in belgium  countries that both locked down and restricted care home visitsaccording to the new york times  of deaths and  of us cases have been reported amongst nursing homes in ten us states the proportion of residents and staffers to have died makes up more than half of all their deathsi think in general the idea in sweden to try to balance the risk of the virus and the risk of closing everything down because there are health problems with that i think on a basic level thats very good he said but i think its a lot of ignorance regarding agingavoiding lockdownsbroadly speaking sweden has closed its international borders including those to neighboring norway and allowed internal society to stay open while there are limits on the maximum amount of people in a social gathering these come in the form of recommendations rather than strict laws enforceable by fines the use of masks on public transport for instance was only formally recommended in decemberoverall the strategy designed in part to be a holistic approach that factored in the pandemicinduced changes across society has remained intact according to karlsoni think the public discussion the official discussion has largely argued that that we have changed the strategy that we have implemented more restrictions and so on he said im not really sure thats true i mean its a shift for sure now we have recommendations to wear masks for example there are stricter restrictions on public order and things like that but we dont have lockdowns its basically recommendationsthe politicization of swedens approach in american politics where prominent republicans have often pointed to their lax approach to masks and lockdowns was another point of contentioni think it worries a lot of people you know in sweden because we love the welfare state and all that he said you know right wing groups in the us starting to favor the swedish strategy and that created some turmoil in swedenwhile the country has not come close to reaching herd immunity  which the health journal the lancet described as their de facto policy in staying open  the lower excess mortality psychological burden and economic performance mean that the policy could yet survive yet another wave of coronavirus infections which have risen in recent weeksstockholm for instance is around  immunity but new variants have made the task more difficultthe political consensus that saw the country get behind their novel covid strategy last summer has broken down karlson said and opposition parties now have called for lockdowns like those seen in other countriesweve tried in different ways you know depending on our culture and our history to adjust you know to minimize the consequences of this terrible disease karlson said but i think sweden has done all right i mean its not as bad as it looks when you look at the death rates which are too high of course\n",

international human rights normsus secretary of state antony blinken took to twitter on sunday night to condemn the abhorrent violence against the people of burma using myanmars former name under british colonial rule blinken said the us government will continue to promote accountability for those responsible and stands firmly with the courageous people of burmasuu kyi has not been seen in public since she was arrested along with other leaders of her nld party on feb  signalling an end to myanmars already fragile experiment with democracysuu kyi who is still revered in myanmar despite losing some of her international luster for her refusal to condemn the armys atrocities against the rohingya muslim minority is understood to have had a tentative shared power agreement with the military since she was named state counsellor in  offering the government a veneer of democratic legitimacy as they embarked on a decade of reforms the role of state counsellor akin to a prime minister or a head of government was created because myanmars  constitution barred suu kyi from becoming president since her late husband and children are foreign citizensthe nov  general election was meant to be a referendum on suu kyis popular civilian government but her party expanded their seats in parliament securing a clear majority and threatening the militarys tight hold on power the constitution guarantees the military  of seats in parliament and control of several key ministriesthe new civilianled government was supposed to convene for the first time on feb  but power was instead handed over to senior gen min aung hlaing commanderinchief of myanmars armed forces who is already under us sanctions for his role in the human rights abuses against the rohingyas an order signed by the acting president granted full authority to hlaing to run the country and declared a state of emergency that will last for at least one year citing widespread voter fraud in the november election hlaings office said in a statement that the military would hold a free and fair general election after the state of emergency ends voter rolls will be checked and the countrys election commission which last week rejected the militarys allegations of voter fraud will be reestablished according to the statementthe military previously ruled myanmar for nearly five decades before appearing to slowly transition to democratic rule a decade ago and holding its first general elections in years in  which was also a landslide victory for the nld suu kyi had spent  years under house arrest while leading the struggle for democracy against the burmese military junta and was awarded the  nobel peace prize for her nonviolent effortssince the feb  takeover a movement of protests across myanmar has been growing  and the junta which calls itself the state administration council has become more and more violent in its response the initial restraint shown by authorities in the immediate aftermath of the bloodless coup has given way to an increased use of lethal force as weeks of internet shutdowns threats and mass arrests have not deterred thousands of people from voicing their oppositionduring suu kyis virtual court appearance in the capital on monday police and protesters faced off again some  miles south in yangon the countrys largest city with videos posted on social media showing clouds of tear gas as protesters clad with construction helmets ran for coversuu kyi has her next court appearance scheduled for march  her lawyer told reuters she is believed to be under house arrest at her residence in naypyidaw if she is found guilty of any of the charges launched against her the resulting prison sentence will likely overlap with the election the junta has promised would take a place in a year\n",
      "africa is on the rise and african people are also ascending one person saidat cape coast castle on the shores of the ghanaian city a sordid history belies its beautythe castle overlooking the atlantic ocean a former slavetrade outpost is home to the socalled door of no return through which millions of africans were forced onto slave ships bound for the united stateseven though you may not know the exact village you come from the township you come from the clan  the family  you come from you can be assured that this is one of the last places that our ancestors touched before leaving these shores said rabbi kohain halevi a board member of the diaspora african forum a nonprofit that in part helps connect visitors to their ancestral historyhundreds of years after those fateful voyages millions of the descendants of those slaves have been returning to the castle  creating a fullcircle momentthats why they say its the door of no return because they believed at that time that if they erased all these things from ourselves that wed never find our way back home halevi said but look at the resiliency of the african spirit and look at who you and i are  that we made our way back homewatch the full story on nightline tonight at  am et on abcactor boris kodjoe is best known for his work on screen in films like brown sugar and the abc tv series station  but when hes off screen he says his mission is much bigger bringing the black diaspora back to africawhen you walk the paths of the dungeons at these slave castles whether its elmina or cape coast you feel the spirits of your ancestors kodjoe said you feel the suffering and the pain and just the atrocities that took place there and you realize at that moment that youre not a descendant of slaves but youre a descendant of survivorsto survive the cruelty of the dungeons to survive the cruelty of the ships and then to survive the terror and the pain of slavery infuses you with so much strength and also commitment to never give up he addedthe yearold actor who was born in vienna to a ghanaian father and austrian mother cofounded the essence full circle festival in  which coordinates trips for descendants of slaves to visit and invest in africa for him the mission was personalmy background is different from a lot of african americans since my father is from ghana  so my roots i never had to retrace im very clear on what my family tree looks like and that knowledge fills you with pride but it also fills you with a sense of identity a sense of culture heritage kodjoe saidits this exact sense of empowerment that he seeks to share with the black communitykodjoe helped organize two trips back to ghana in  and  for black hollywood stars influencers and entrepreneurs to reconnect with their ancestry he said among those invited were blackish star anthony anderson supermodel naomi campbell and the wire star idris elbathe full circle festival took guests to places with significance to the slave trade in ghana including the door of no return the assin manso slave river and jamestown  the oldest district in the nations capital accraobserving friends who were part of this pilgrimage if you will reconnect with their ancestry has been the most overwhelming and just fulfilling experience kodjoe said to see in their eyes the realization that their ancestry gives them roots and a sense of belonging and therefore a sense of purpose it is such an important experience that you want everybody to have that experienceguests were told about their ancestors history and given tours of ghanas neighborhoods and beaches they were also welcomed at president nana akufoaddos home for a reception dinnertheres a lot of history thats shared between the continent and the diaspora if you will so to me full circle festival represents the honoring of our ancestry but also the realization that we have to build this bridge between the diaspora and the continent in order to address those generational traumas that we have suffered on both continents kodjoe saida large part of the festival involves being honest about those traumas and examining the lingering emotional and economic effects of colonialismthere is this disparity that has been carried from one generation to the next over hundreds and hundreds of years kodjoe explained the goal is to first acknowledge our history and realize that this generational wealth didnt just appear but it was systematically prepared and there were mechanisms put in place to ensure that certain people were at an advantage and others werentin the united states the median and mean wealth of black families is  less than that of a white families according to a  survey from the federal reservethe wealth gap has been growing according to the brookings institute said in a  report that the ratio of white family wealth to black family wealth is higher today than it was at the start of the century  a result in part of white families inheriting wealthkodjoe says there are actually certain steps we can undertake collectively to reduce that wealth gap and to make things righta large part of kodjoes efforts have been to rectify false narratives about africa that persist to this dayweve been told so many lies in the past hundred years about africa that have kept us from it he said this newfound excitement and interest has ignited a wave of not just tourism but people coming to africa to experience not just the culture but also investing in africathe traditional narrative about africa has been dominated by poverty war corruption mass exodus to europe he added theres vibrancy and music and food and people and sights and theres tremendous potential in terms of economic developmentin  akufoaddo called for the descendants of slaves to visit the country and commemorate the th anniversary of the transatlantic slave trade which he triumphantly called the year of returntourism boomed in ghana that year with nearly a million tourists touching down  most of them hailing from the usexperts say ancestry dna tests are a driving force behind some of the travel the united states has also seen a racial reckoning unfold over the last few years with protests across the country decrying racism and police brutality the heightened focus on the black identity has also contributed to a wave of interest in descendants african rootsfull circle festival has done more than just reconnect visitors with their past too its reinvested in africa as well already generating over  billion toward the local economyfull circle festival started changing the narrative about africa specifically ghana kodjoe said we noticed that after just one year we had helped stimulate the economy by  billion and that was of utmost importance to show people the diversity and the vibrancy and the potential for not just tourism but business in africasince moving to ghana over two decades ago rabbi halevi has guided newcomers through monuments of the pastghana has been the gateway for millions of africans that were taken away from this soil to various parts of the diaspora throughout the last couple of centuries and now we find that has reversed he said ghana is now a gateway for hundreds of thousands and hopefully millions of africans in the diaspora to return back to mother africa through the gateway of ghanaone place he takes visitors is the assin manso slave river site where africans from various parts of the continent had their last bath on their native land before being sold into servitudeour ancestors believe if you walked barefoot with it youre connected all the time with its strength and its power halevi told a group of touristshow many people will lay on this ground to get the strength of mother earth back in your body thats where the strength comes from  we take our shoes off at the river bathe in the river he addedhalevi praised the influx of visitors to ghana saying africa is a place we can also come and enjoy its not a place of agony and pain sickness and starvation its a place that is on the rise as the place is being rebuilt after centuries of devastation and for sons and daughters having been ripped from her wombafrica is on the rise and african people are also ascending he addedkodjoe said he hopes that these trips will change how the world views and engages with africathe goal is to continue to change that narrative and engage with the diaspora build a bridge between the diaspora and the continent which then hopefully will result in more economic development investment he

wounds our lady of salvation which belongs to the syriac catholic church is one of the pontiffs first stops in a historic visit to iraq that christians hope will secure their tenuous place in the countrythe popes visit is hope for us that he will talk with iraqi officials to tell them to stop the violence stop the armed groups and protect minorities climis saidon that fateful day in  climis then  was a youth leader at the church he had arrived just in time for weekly mass with his yearold son radi his wife and other children stayed home to supervise kitchen repairs for this climis would later be thankfulthe lofty church interiors resounded with the voice of father thair reading a bible passage he would never finish it was right then that the first suicide bomber detonated his

of the virgin mary one began singing the adhan the islamic call to prayerquickly climis grabbed his son and ran toward the sacristy room where church furnishings and records were stored as people scrambled for cover he beckoned them inside with over  people in the room he shut the wooden doors and slid a steel rod to bar the handlesbut it was very thin any one of the four terrorists could enter the room and kill us easily he said recalling the scene from his baghdad homeclimis and his son lay frozen on the floor listening to the horrors on the other side of the door shrieks were followed by bullets children cried out explosion after explosion shook the wallsone gunman told a mother to quiet her wailing infant when she was unable climis heard the pop of a bullet the screaming ceasedhe could hear father wassim his friend try and reason with the men he too was shot and killedfrom a small hole in the door he eyed another gunman standing just a few feet awayhow young he was he

he is still deaf in his right eardesperate he called a friend who worked in the baghdad operations command half an hour and help would come the friend told himfour panicstricken hours later the lights suddenly went off climis braced for the worst another explosion followed louder than any before then the rush of footsteps and volley of firearmsiraqs elite counterterrorism service stormed the church at  pm but climis didnt let anyone leave the room  they had no idea what was going onafter a minute someone knocked on the door and a voice came i am your brother from the cts and everyone will leave this church safelyclimis had to see his beloved church one last time the cts officer told him no it was very dangerous there could be iedsbut he dared to look anywayi dont wish anyone to see what i saw body parts everywhere i saw one body with just a head hands and chest the rest was blown apartthen his gaze turned up toward the vaulted ceilingthere were scraps of human flesh he said it stayed there for weeksin total  worshippers and police were killed in the attack and the ensuing raid by security forces to free the hostages the islamic state of iraq an alqaidaaffiliated group claimed the attackfour years later a new iteration of the group calling itself the islamic state in iraq and syria would overrun vast swaths of northern iraq pushing out entire christian communities prompting concerns of more marginalization within the historic iraqi minority later shiite militia groups would move in and erect checkpoints provoking fear among those who remainedtwo events that traumatic october night sowed the seeds of distrust for over a decade to comeas gunmen wreaked havoc inside the church someone fired shots from the outside through a window into the sacristy climis couldnt see who but thought they were outsiders supporting the terroristsin fact it was the federal police who mistakenly fired during the hourslong standoff a row later ensued between them and the cts over the incident other witnesses saidthe bullets are still lodged in books stacked in the sacristy climis saidthe second event still haunts climis why upon arriving to the church he asks did the cts wait and not launch the raid directlythey did not enter until they got permission from iraqs government he said the waiting cost precious livesthat day he said the iraqi government did not do their duty toward us an ancient iraqi communitythe bloodbath shook iraqs christians to the core their exodus had begun after the  us invasion but increased markedly after the massacre one by one many of climis friends and family began leaving seeing no hope for justicewith the is onslaught a few years later little has changed to improve their lot most of climis family hails from the northern christian town of qaraqosh but are scattered around the world he has run out of fingers to count the various countries where his relatives residethe popes visit to iraq brings hope that he might be able to not only reconnect iraqs christians to their homeland but also talk sense into iraqi leaders who have so far neglected them climis saiddespite his community shrinking around him climis has remained in iraq with his family today he is a deacon in the our lady of salvation church which is open and holds regular services still with security presence outside the immaculate interiors show no signs of its dark history but the memory of those terrifying hours is still etched in the minds of its worshippersso why did climis staybecause this is my country he said\n"
